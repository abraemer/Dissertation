	abstract = {We investigate the stability of the many-body localized (MBL) phase for a system in contact with a single ergodic grain, modelling a Griffiths region with low disorder. Our numerical analysis provides evidence that even a small ergodic grain consisting of only 3 qubits can delocalize a localized chain, as soon as the localization length exceeds a critical value separating localized and extended regimes of the whole system. We present a simple theory, consistent with the arguments in [Phys. Rev. B 95, 155129 (2017)], that assumes a system to be locally ergodic unless the local relaxation time, determined by Fermi's Golden Rule, is larger than the inverse level spacing. This theory predicts a critical value for the localization length that is perfectly consistent with our numerical calculations. We analyze in detail the behavior of local operators inside and outside the ergodic grain, and find excellent agreement of numerics and theory.},

	abstract = {We study the many-body localization (MBL) transition in a generalized Aubry-Andr{\'e} model (also known as the GPD model) introduced by Ganeshan, Pixley, and Das Sarma []. In contrast to MBL in other disordered or quasiperiodic models, the interaction seems to unexpectedly enhance MBL in the GPD model in some parameter range. To understand this counterintuitive result, we demonstrate that the highest-energy single-particle band in the GPD model is unstable against weak disorder, which leads to this surprising MBL phenomenon in the interacting model. We develop a mean-field theory description to understand the coupling between extended and localized states, which we validate using extensive exact diagonalization and modified density matrix renormalization group (DMRG-X) numerical results.

The time evolution of simple (unentangled) initial states is studied numerically for a system of interacting spinless fermions in one dimension described by the random-field XXZ Hamiltonian. Interactions induce a dramatic change in the propagation of entanglement and a smaller change in the propagation of particles. For even weak interactions, when the system is thought to be in a many-body localized phase, entanglement shows neither localized nor diffusive behavior but grows without limit in an infinite system: interactions act as a singular perturbation on the localized state with no interactions. The significance for proposed atomic experiments is that local measurements will show a large but non-thermal entropy in the many-body localized state. This entropy develops slowly (approximately logarithmically) over a diverging time scale as in glassy systems.},

We describe the evolution of this idea from the initial conjecture, to the perturbative constructions, to the mathematical proof given for a disordered spin chain. We discuss the proposed numerical algorithms for the construction of LIOMs and the status of the debate on the existence and nature of such operators in systems with a many-body mobility edge, and in dimensions larger than one.},
