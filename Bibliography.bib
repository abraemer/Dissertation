	abstract = {We investigate the stability of the many-body localized (MBL) phase for a system in contact with a single ergodic grain, modelling a Griffiths region with low disorder. Our numerical analysis provides evidence that even a small ergodic grain consisting of only 3 qubits can delocalize a localized chain, as soon as the localization length exceeds a critical value separating localized and extended regimes of the whole system. We present a simple theory, consistent with the arguments in [Phys. Rev. B 95, 155129 (2017)], that assumes a system to be locally ergodic unless the local relaxation time, determined by Fermi's Golden Rule, is larger than the inverse level spacing. This theory predicts a critical value for the localization length that is perfectly consistent with our numerical calculations. We analyze in detail the behavior of local operators inside and outside the ergodic grain, and find excellent agreement of numerics and theory.},

The time evolution of simple (unentangled) initial states is studied numerically for a system of interacting spinless fermions in one dimension described by the random-field XXZ Hamiltonian. Interactions induce a dramatic change in the propagation of entanglement and a smaller change in the propagation of particles. For even weak interactions, when the system is thought to be in a many-body localized phase, entanglement shows neither localized nor diffusive behavior but grows without limit in an infinite system: interactions act as a singular perturbation on the localized state with no interactions. The significance for proposed atomic experiments is that local measurements will show a large but non-thermal entropy in the many-body localized state. This entropy develops slowly (approximately logarithmically) over a diverging time scale as in glassy systems.},

We prove, with virtually full generality, that reaching equilibrium is a universal property of quantum systems: Almost any subsystem in interaction with a large enough bath will reach an equilibrium state and remain close to it for almost all times.

Berry's conjecture is expected to hold only if the corresponding classical system is chaotic, and essentially states that the energy eigenfunctions behave as if they were gaussian random variables. We review the existing evidence, and show that previously neglected effects substantially strengthen the case for Berry's conjecture. We study a rarefied hard-sphere gas as an explicit example of a many-body system which is known to be classically chaotic, and show that an energy eigenstate which obeys Berry's conjecture predicts a Maxwell--Boltzmann, Bose--Einstein, or Fermi--Dirac distribution for the momentum of each constituent particle, depending on whether the wave functions are taken to be nonsymmetric, completely symmetric, or completely antisymmetric functions of the positions of the particles. We call this phenomenon eigenstate thermalization. We show that a generic initial state will approach thermal equilibrium at least as fast as O(h{\textasciimacron}/∆)t-1, where ∆ is the uncertainty in the total energy of the gas. This result holds for an individual initial state; in contrast to the classical theory, no averaging over an ensemble of initial states is needed. We argue that these results constitute a new foundation for quantum statistical mechanics.},

	abstract = {Time dynamics of isolated many-body quantum systems has long been an elusive subject. Very recently, however, meaningful experimental studies of the problem have finally become possible, stimulating theoretical interest as well. Progress in this field is perhaps most urgently needed in the foundations of quantum statistical mechanics. This is so because in generic isolated systems, one expects nonequilibrium dynamics on its own to result in thermalization: a relaxation to states where the values of macroscopic quantities are stationary, universal with respect to widely differing initial conditions, and predictable through the time-tested recipe of statistical mechanics. However, it is not obvious what feature of many-body quantum mechanics makes quantum thermalization possible, in a sense analogous to that in which dynamical chaos makes classical thermalization possible. For example, dynamical chaos itself cannot occur in an isolated quantum system, where time evolution is linear and the spectrum is discrete. Underscoring that new rules could apply in this case, some recent studies even suggested that statistical mechanics may give wrong predictions for the outcomes of relaxation in such systems. Here we demonstrate that an isolated generic quantum many-body system does in fact relax to a state well-described by the standard statistical mechanical prescription. Moreover, we show that time evolution itself plays a merely auxiliary role in relaxation and that thermalization happens instead at the level of individual eigenstates, as first proposed by J.M. Deutsch and M. Srednicki. A striking consequence of this eigenstate thermalization scenario is that the knowledge of a single many-body eigenstate suffices to compute thermal averages-any eigenstate in the microcanonical energy window will do, as they all give the same result.},

Here we review how similar questions can be answered in quantum systems. The crucial point is that individual energy eigenstates behave in many ways like a statistical ensemble.

The reasons for why it works in so many cases are rooted in the early work of Wigner on random matrix theory and our understanding of quantum chaos. The ETH has now been studied extensively by both analytic and numerical means, and applied to a number of physical situations ranging from black hole physics to condensed matter systems. It has recently become the focus of a number of experiments in highly isolated systems. Current theoretical work also focuses on where the ETH breaks down leading to new interesting phenomena. This review of the ETH takes a somewhat intuitive approach as to why it works and how this informs our understanding of many body quantum states.},

If V(r) decreases with the distance r slower than 1/r{\textasciicircum}d in a d-dimensional system then all excitations are delocalized at arbitrarily strong disordering, due to the resonant interaction of far separated quantum states (Fig. 1). At finite temperature T{$>$}0 the density of excitations is finite and they can influence each other by means of their interaction. Many body excitations involving simultaneous transitions of several single particle excitations create additional channels for energy delocalization and transport. Here we show that if the interaction of excitations decreases with the distance slower than 1/R{\textasciicircum}(2d) then excitations are delocalized at finite temperature irrespectively to disordering. This delocalization results in the finite decoherence rate in the ensemble of interacting spins 1/2 representing the model of quantum computer, thus restricting the quantum hardware performance. It also leads to the energy and particle delocalization and transport at finite temperature in various physical systems including doped semiconductors, despite of the full localization of electrons at zero temperature.},

For sufficiently rapidly decaying interactions {$\alpha$} {$>$} {$\alpha$}c we find a many-body localized phase, in which I(t) saturates to a non-zero value, entanglement entropy grows as S(t) {$\propto$} t1/{$\alpha$} , and Fisher information grows logarithmically.

	abstract = {Many-body localization in an XY model with a long-range interaction is investigated. We show that in the regime of a high strength of disordering compared to the interaction an off-resonant flip-flop spin-spin interaction (hopping) generates the effective Ising interactions of spins in the third order of perturbation theory in a hopping. The combination of hopping and induced Ising interactions for the power-law distance dependent hopping V (R) {$\propto$} R -{$\alpha$} always leads to the localization breakdown in a thermodynamic limit of an infinite system at {$\alpha$} {$<$} 3d/2 where d is a system dimension. The delocalization takes place due to the induced Ising interactions U (R) {$\propto$} R -2{$\alpha$} of ``extended'' resonant pairs. This prediction is consistent with the numerical finite size scaling in one-dimensional systems. Many-body localization in an XY model is more stable with respect to the long- range interaction compared to a many-body problem with similar Ising and Heisenberg interactions requiring {$\alpha$} ⩾ 2d which makes the practical implementations of this model more attractive for quantum information applications. The full summary of dimension constraints and localization threshold size dependencies for many- body localization in the case of combined Ising and hopping interactions is obtained using this and previous work and it is the subject for the future experimental verification using cold atomic systems.},

	abstract = {Quantum information theoretical measures are useful tools for characterizing quantum dynamical phases. However, employing them to study excited states of random spin systems is a challenging problem. Here, we report results for the entanglement entropy (EE) scaling of excited eigenstates of random XX antiferromagnetic spin chains with long-range (LR) interactions decaying as a power law with distance with exponent \${\textbackslash}alpha\$. To this end, we extend the real-space renormalization group technique for excited states (RSRG-X) to solve this problem with LR interaction. For comparison, we perform numerical exact diagonalization (ED) calculations. From the distribution of energy level spacings, as obtained by ED for up to \$N{\textbackslash}sim 18\$ spins, we find indications of a delocalization transition at \${\textbackslash}alpha\_c {\textbackslash}approx 1\$ in the middle of the energy spectrum. With RSRG-X and ED, we show that for \${\textbackslash}alpha{$>\backslash$}alpha{\textasciicircum}*\$ the entanglement entropy (EE) of excited eigenstates retains a logarithmic divergence similar to the one observed for the ground state of the same model, while for \${\textbackslash}alpha{$<\backslash$}alpha{\textasciicircum}*\$ EE displays an algebraic growth with the subsystem size \$l\$, \$S\_l{\textbackslash}sim l{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}beta\}\$, with \$0{$<\backslash$}beta{$<$}1\$. We find that \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textasciicircum}* {\textbackslash}approx 1\$ coincides with the delocalization transition \${\textbackslash}alpha\_c\$ in the middle of the many-body spectrum. An interpretation of these results based on the structure of the RG rules is proposed, which is due to \{{\textbackslash}it rainbow\} proliferation for very long-range interactions \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash}ll 1\$. We also investigate the effective temperature dependence of the EE allowing us to study the half-chain entanglement entropy of eigenstates at different energy densities, where we find that the crossover in EE occurs at \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textasciicircum}* {$<$} 1\$.},

In the computational basis, excluding all trivial degeneracies, the interaction-induced localization is well demonstrated in aspects of level statistics, eigenstate expectation values, and the Anderson localization on graphs constructed of the many-body basis. The nature of localization for generic eigenstates is attributed to the quasi-disorder from the power-law interactions. However, due to the real-space symmetries, the long-time dynamics is dominated by the degenerate eigen- states and eventually reach homogeneity in real space.

The total magnetization is found to exhibit sub-exponential relaxation analogous to classical glassy dynamics, but in the quantum case this relaxation originates from the build-up of non-classical correlations. In both experiment and semi-classical simulations, we find the evolution towards a randomized state is independent of the strength of disorder up to a critical value. This hints towards a unifying description of relaxation dynamics in disordered isolated quantum systems, analogous to the generalization of statistical mechanics to out-of-equilibrium scenarios in classical spin glasses.},

This we observe for both time-independent and periodically driven (Floquet) systems. Finite-size analysis indicates the persistence of this non-thermal relaxation regime in the thermodynamic limit thus defining a distinct dynamical regime. This regime exhibits a peak in the time-scale of the perceptible relaxation, upon crossing over from weak to strong disorder. We provide a simple picture of this behavior, which naturally accounts for its general occurrence. Formation of spin-glass -- one of the possible mechanisms for stretched relaxation appears incidental to the occurrence of Kohlrausch law in our context. Finally, we provide a simple non-Hermitian Hamiltonian formulation for the dynamics of a single spin embedded in the disordered chain. This provides an analytical formula that captures not only the Kohlrausch relaxation of the disorder averaged auto-correlation but also captures the largely diverse dynamics of an arbitrary target spin in the system. Our work hence also provides a concrete quantification of the ``pre-thermal slowness" in many-body disordered system.},

This method is based on general- ization of the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) to a higher dimensional phase space, where phase space variables are associated with a complete set of quantum operators spanning finite size clusters. The method becomes asymptotically exact with the increasing cluster size. The crucial feature of TWA is fluctuating initial conditions, which we approximate by a Gaussian distribution. We show that such fluctuations dramatically in- crease accuracy of TWA over traditional cluster mean field approximations. In this way we can treat on equal footing quantum and thermal fluctuations as well as compute entanglement and various equal and non-equal time correlation functions. The main limitation of the method is exponential scaling of the phase space dimen- sionality with the cluster size, which can be significantly reduced by using the language of Schwinger bosons and can likely be further reduced by truncating the local Hilbert space variables. We demonstrate the power of this method analyzing dynamics in various spin chains with and without disorder and show that we can cap- ture such phenomena as long time hydrodynamic relaxation, many-body localization and the ballistic spread of entanglement.},

	abstract = {We study time dynamics of 1D disordered Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain focusing on a regime of large system sizes and a long time evolution. This regime is relevant for observation of many-body localization (MBL), a phenomenon that is expected to freeze the dynamics of the system and prevent it from reaching thermal equilibrium. Performing extensive numerical simulations of the imbalance, a quantity often employed in the experimental studies of MBL, we show that the regime of a slow power-law decay of imbalance persists to disorder strengths exceeding by at least a factor of 2 the current estimates of the critical disorder strength for MBL. Even though we investigate time evolution up to few thousands tunneling times, we observe no signs of the saturation of imbalance that would suggest freezing of system dynamics and provide a smoking gun evidence of MBL. We demonstrate that the situation is qualitatively different when the disorder is replaced by a quasiperiodic potential. In this case, we observe an emergence of a pattern of oscillations of the imbalance that is stable with respect to changes in the system size. This suggests that the dynamics of quasiperiodic systems remain fully local at the longest time scales we reach provided that the quasiperiodic potential is sufficiently strong. Our study identifies challenges in an unequivocal experimental observation of the phenomenon of MBL.},

This includes topological phases protected in part by time-translation symmetry, as well as phases distinguished by the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry, dubbed ``Floquet time crystals.'' We show that such phases of matter can exist in the prethermal regime of periodically driven systems, which exists generically for sufficiently large drive frequency, thereby eliminating the need for integrability or strong quenched disorder, which limited previous constructions. We prove a theorem that states that such a prethermal regime persists until times that are nearly exponentially long in the ratio of certain couplings to the drive frequency. By similar techniques, we can also construct stationary systems that spontaneously break continuous time-translation symmetry. Furthermore, we argue that for driven systems coupled to a cold bath, the prethermal regime could potentially persist to infinite time.},

We give a definition of discrete time crystals from several points of view, emphasizing that they are a nonequilibrium phenomenon that is stabilized by many-body interactions, with no analog in noninteracting systems.

The origin of such a many-body localized phase has been described as localization in Fock space, a picture we examine numerically. We then formulate a precise sense in which a single energy eigenstate of a Hamiltonian can be adiabatically connected to a state of a non-interacting Anderson insulator. We call such a state a many-body localized state and define a many-body localized phase as one in which almost all states are many-body localized states. We explore the possible consequences of this; the most striking is an area law for the entanglement entropy of almost all excited states in a many-body localized phase. We present the results of numerical calculations for a one-dimensional system of spinless fermions. Our results are consistent with an area law and, by implication, many-body localization for almost all states and almost all regions for weak enough interactions and strong disorder. However, there are rare regions and rare states with much larger entanglement entropies. Furthermore, we study the implications that many-body localization may have for topological phases and self-correcting quantum memories. We find that there are scenarios in which many-body localization can help to stabilize topological order at non-zero energy density, and we propose potentially useful criteria to confirm these scenarios.},

The delocalized, ergodic phase looks more localized than the corresponding single-particle AL and RMT does not seem to be a good approximation, not even deep in the delocalized region. The localized region seems very akin to the case of single particle AL on the Bethe lattice with connectivity O (1), in particular the distribution functions of the amplitudes show a small-x accumulation which points towards wave functions localized in configuration space. We have also identified similarities and differences with this better studied case and suggested what are the necessary ingredients for a viable analytical study of MBL.},

We study the distribution of matrix elements of a local operator between the system's eigenstates, finding a qualitatively different behaviour in the many-body localized (MBL) and ergodic phases. To characterize how strongly a local perturbation modifies the eigenstates, we introduce the parameter \$\{{\textbackslash}cal G\}(L)={\textbackslash}langle {\textbackslash}ln (V\_\{nm\}/{\textbackslash}delta) {\textbackslash}rangle\$, which represents a disorder-averaged ratio of a typical matrix element of a local operator \$V\$ to the energy level spacing, \${\textbackslash}delta\$; this parameter is reminiscent of the Thouless conductance in the single-particle localization. We show that the parameter \$\{{\textbackslash}cal G\}(L)\$ decreases with system size \$L\$ in the MBL phase, and grows in the ergodic phase. We surmise that the delocalization transition occurs when \$\{{\textbackslash}cal G\}(L)\$ is independent of system size, \$\{{\textbackslash}cal G\}(L)=\{{\textbackslash}cal G\}\_c{\textbackslash}sim 1\$. We illustrate our approach by studying the many-body localization transition and resolving the many-body mobility edge in a disordered 1D XXZ spin-1/2 chain using exact diagonalization and time-evolving block decimation methods. Our criterion for the MBL transition gives insights into microscopic details of transition. Its direct physical consequences, in particular logarithmically slow transport at the transition, and extensive entanglement entropy of the eigenstates, are consistent with recent renormalization group predictions.},

	abstract = {Thermalizing quantum systems are conventionally described by statistical mechanics at equilibrium. However, not all systems fall into this category, with many body localization providing a generic mechanism for thermalization to fail in strongly disordered systems. Many-body localized (MBL) systems remain perfect insulators at non-zero temperature, which do not thermalize and therefore cannot be described using statistical mechanics. In this Colloquium we review recent theoretical and experimental advances in studies of MBL systems, focusing on the new perspective provided by entanglement and non-equilibrium experimental probes such as quantum quenches. Theoretically, MBL systems exhibit a new kind of robust integrability: an extensive set of quasi-local integrals of motion emerges, which provides an intuitive explanation of the breakdown of thermalization. A description based on quasi-local integrals of motion is used to predict dynamical properties of MBL systems, such as the spreading of quantum entanglement, the behavior of local observables, and the response to external dissipative processes. Furthermore, MBL systems can exhibit eigenstate transitions and quantum orders forbidden in thermodynamic equilibrium. We outline the current theoretical understanding of the quantum-to-classical transition between many-body localized and ergodic phases, and anomalous transport in the vicinity of that transition. Experimentally, synthetic quantum systems, which are well-isolated from an external thermal reservoir, provide natural platforms for realizing the MBL phase. We review recent experiments with ultracold atoms, trapped ions, superconducting qubits, and quantum materials, in which different signatures of many-body localization have been observed. We conclude by listing outstanding challenges and promising future research directions.},

The model maps onto a tight-binding model on a `Fock-space (FS) lattice' of many-body states, with an extensive local connectivity. We seek to understand some aspects of MBL from this perspective, via local propagators for the FS lattice and their self-energies (SE's), focusing on the SE probability distributions, over disorder and FS sites. A probabilistic mean-field theory (MFT) is first developed, centered on self-consistent determination of the geometric mean of the distribution. Despite its simplicity this captures some key features of the problem, including recovery of an MBL transition, and predictions for the forms of the SE distributions. The problem is then studied numerically in 1d by exact diagonalization, free from MFT assumptions. The geometric mean indeed appears to act as a suitable order parameter for the transition. Throughout the MBL phase the appropriate SE distribution is confirmed to have a universal form, with long- tailed L{\'e}vy behavior as predicted by MFT. In the delocalized phase for weak disorder, SE distributions are clearly log-normal, while on approaching the transition they acquire an intermediate L{\'e}vy-tail regime, indicative of the incipient MBL phase.},

We focus on the level statistics of the entanglement spectrum as obtained through numerical diagonalization, finding structure beyond that revealed by more limited measures such as entanglement entropy. In the thermalizing phase the entanglement spectrum obeys level statistics governed by an appropriate random matrix ensemble. For Hamiltonian systems this can be viewed as evidence in favor of a strong version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). Similar results are also obtained for Floquet systems, where they constitute a result ``beyond ETH'' and show that the corrections to ETH governing the Floquet entanglement spectrum have statistical properties governed by a random matrix ensemble. The particular random matrix ensemble governing the Floquet entanglement spectrum depends on the symmetries of the Floquet drive and therefore can depend on the choice of origin of time. In the many-body localized phase the entanglement spectrum is also found to show level repulsion, following a semi-Poisson distribution (in contrast to the energy spectrum, which follows a Poisson distribution). This semi-Poisson distribution is found to come mainly from states at high entanglement energies. The observed level repulsion occurs only for interacting localized phases. We also demonstrate that equivalent results can be obtained by calculating with a single typical eigenstate or by averaging over a microcanonical energy window, a surprising result in the localized phase. This discovery of new structure in the pattern of entanglement of localized and thermalizing phases may open up new lines of attack on many-body localization, thermalization, and the localization transition.}

We find that fluctuations are normally distributed, and their standard deviation decays in the thermodynamic limit as L{\textasciicircum}\{-1/2\}, with L the size of the chain. This is in contrast with the exponential decay that is found in generic non-integrable systems. Based on our results, it is natural to expect that this scenario holds in other integrable spin models and for typical local observables.

We show that even the most extreme outliers appear to obey ETH as the system size increases, and thus provide numerical evidences that support ETH in this strong sense.

	abstract = {Local integrals of motion play a central role in the understanding of many-body localization in many-body quantum systems in one dimension subject to a random external potential, but the question of how these local integrals of motion change in a deterministic quasiperiodic potential is one that has received significantly less attention. Here we develop a powerful new implementation of the continuous unitary transform formalism and use this method to directly compute both the effective Hamiltonian and the local integrals of motion for many-body quantum systems subject to a quasiperiodic potential. We show that the effective interactions between local integrals of motion retain a strong fingerprint of the underlying quasiperiodic potential, exhibiting sharp features at distances associated with the incommensurate wavelength used to generate the potential. Furthermore, the local integrals of motion themselves may be expressed in terms of an operator expansion which allows us to estimate the critical strength of quasiperiodic potential required to lead to a localization/delocalization transition, by means of a finite size scaling analysis.},

To better understand the role played by the existence of such macroscopically LIOMs, we explore and study some of their structural properties across the MBL transition. We first, consider a one-dimensional XXZ spin chain in a disordered magnetic field and introduce and implement a non-perturbative, fast, and accurate method of constructing LIOMs. In contrast to already existing methods, our scheme allows obtaining LIOMs not only in the deep MBL phase but rather, near the transition point too. Then, we take the matrix representation of LIOM operators as an adjacency matrix of a directed graph whose elements describe the connectivity of ordered eigenbasis in the Hilbert-space. Our cluster size analysis for this graph shows that the MBL transition coincides with a percolation transition in the Hilbert-space. By performing finite-size scaling, we compare the critical disorder and correlation exponent {$\nu$} both in the presence and absence of interaction. Finally, we also discuss how the distribution of diagonal elements of LIOM operators in a typical cluster signals the transition.},

One example of such a transition is the recently proposed many-body localization-delocalization transition, in which transport coefficients vanish at a critical temperature with no singularities in thermodynamic observables. Describing this purely dynamical quantum criticality is technically challenging as understanding the finite-temperature dynamics necessarily requires averaging over a large number of matrix elements between many-body eigenstates. Here, we develop a real-space renormalization group method for excited states that allows us to overcome this challenge in a large class of models. We characterize a specific example: the 1 D disordered transverse- field Ising model with generic interactions. While thermodynamic phase transitions are generally forbidden in this model, using the real-space renormalization group method for excited states we find a finite- temperature dynamical transition between two localized phases. The transition is characterized by nonanalyticities in the low-frequency heat conductivity and in the long-time (dynamic) spin correlation function. The latter is a consequence of an up-down spin symmetry that results in the appearance of an Edwards-Anderson-like order parameter in one of the localized phases.},

The particle number fluctuations by contrast exhibit much slower growth as log(log(t)) indicating blocked particle transport. Lack of true thermalization in the long time limit is attributed to an infinite set of approximate integrals of motion revealed in the course of the RG flow, which become asymptotically exact conservation laws at the fixed point.

The results of this theory are corroborated and intuitively explained with a phenomenological effective description of the critical point and of the ``badly conducting'' state found near the critical point on the delocalized side. The theory leads to the following sharp predictions: (i) The delocalized state established near the transition is a Griffiths phase, which exhibits subdiffusive transport of conserved quantities and sub-ballistic spreading of entanglement. The anomalous diffusion exponent {$\alpha$} {$<$} 1=2 vanishes continuously at the critical point. The system does thermalize in this Griffiths phase. (ii) The many-body localization transition is controlled by a new kind of infinite-randomness RG fixed point, where the broadly distributed scaling variable is closely related to the eigenstate entanglement entropy. Dynamically, the entanglement grows as {$\sim$} log t at the critical point, as it does in the localized phase. (iii) In the vicinity of the critical point, the ratio of the entanglement entropy to the thermal entropy and its variance (and, in fact, all moments) are scaling functions of L={$\xi$}, where L is the length of the system and {$\xi$} is the correlation length, which has a power-law divergence at the critical point.},

	abstract = {Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time? This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.},

Some of the phase transitions that occur between antiferromagnetically ordered phases and random singlet or other antiferromagnetic phases are also analyzed.

In particular, the exact scaling function is obtained for the magnetization as a function of a uniform applied magnetic field and the distance to the critical point, and up to the solution of a linear ordinary differential equation whose solution can be exhaustively analyzed, the scaling function of the average spin-spin correlation function is also obtained. Thus more exact information is obtainable about the critical behavior for this random model than is known for the pure version which is equivalent to the two-dimensional Ising model. The basic reason for this is the extremely broad distribution of energy scales that occurs at low energies near the critical point of the random system. For the random chain the distribution of the magnetization of the first spin in a semi-infinite system is also studied and the results found to agree in the scaling limit with results of McCoy obtained from the exact solution of the closely related McCoy-Wu Ising model; this provides strong justification for the validity of the present approach. The singular properties of the weakly ordered and weakly disordered ``Griffiths' phases'' that occur at zero temperature near the critical point are also studied, as well as the behavior at low but nonzero temperature.

	abstract = {Quantum systems can exhibit a great deal of universality at low temperature due to the structure of ground states and the critical points separating distinct states. On the other hand, quantum time evolution of the same systems involves all energies and it is therefore thought to be much harder, if at all possible, to have sharp transitions in the dynamics. In this paper we show that phase transitions characterized by universal singularities do occur in the time evolution of random spin chains. The sharpness of the transitions and integrity of the phases owes to many-body localization, which prevents thermalization in these systems. Using a renormalization group approach, we solve the time evolution of random Ising spin chains with generic interactions starting from initial states of arbitrary energy. As a function of the Hamiltonian parameters, the system is tuned through a dynamical transition, similar to the ground state critical point, at which the local spin correlations establish true long range temporal order. In the state with dominant transverse field, a spin that starts in an up state loses its orientation with time, while in the "ordered" state it never does. As in ground state quantum phase transitions, the dynamical transition has unique signatures in the entanglement properties of the system. When the system is initialized in a product state the entanglement entropy grows as \$log(t)\$ in the two "phases", while at the critical point it grows as \$log{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}a(t)\$, with \${\textbackslash}a\$ a universal number. This universal entanglement growth requires generic ("integrability breaking") interactions to be added to the pure transverse field Ising model.},

To illustrate the renormalization-group analysis, we focus on the quantum Ising Hamiltonian with random site- and time-dependent (adiabatic) transverse-field and nearest-neighbour exchange couplings. We demonstrate how the method works in detail, by calculating the off-critical flows and recovering the ground state properties of the Hamiltonian such as magnetization and correlation functions. The adiabatic time allows us to traverse the parameter space, remaining near-to the ground state which is broadened if the rate of change of the Hamiltonian is finite. The quantum critical point, or points, depend on time through the time-dependence of the parameters of the Hamiltonian. We, furthermore, make connections with Kibble-Zurek dynamics and provide a scaling argument for the density of defects as we adiabatically pass through the critical point of the system.},

	abstract = {There is a large variety of quantum and classical systems in which the quenched disorder plays a dominant r{\textasciicircum}ole over quantum, thermal, or stochastic fluctuations : these systems display strong spatial heterogeneities, and many averaged observables are actually governed by rare regions. A unifying approach to treat the dynamical and/or static singularities of these systems has emerged recently, following the pioneering RG idea by Ma and Dasgupta and the detailed analysis by Fisher who showed that the Ma-Dasgupta RG rules yield asymptotic exact results if the broadness of the disorder grows indefinitely at large scales. Here we report these new developments by starting with an introduction of the main ingredients of the strong disorder RG method. We describe the basic properties of infinite disorder fixed points, which are realized at critical points, and of strong disorder fixed points, which control the singular behaviors in the Griffiths-phases. We then review in detail applications of the RG method to various disordered models, either (i) quantum models, such as random spin chains, ladders and higher dimensional spin systems, or (ii) classical models, such as diffusion in a random potential , equilibrium at low temperature and coarsening dynamics of classical random spin chains, trap models, delocalization transition of a random polymer from an interface, driven lattice gases and reaction diffusion models in the presence of quenched disorder. For several one-dimensional systems, the Ma-Dasgupta RG rules yields very detailed analytical results, whereas for other, mainly higher dimensional problems, the RG rules have to be implemented numerically. If available, the strong disorder RG results are compared with another, exact or numerical calculations.},

We find a new subextensive scaling with system size of the above measures for algebraic localization as noticed in one-dimensional long-range hopping models in the presence of uncorrelated disorder. While the scaling exponent of EE seems to vary universally with the long distance localization exponent of single particle states (SPSs), PR does not show such university as it also depends on the short-range correlations of SPSs. On the other hand, in the presence of correlated disorder, an admixture of two species of SPSs (ergodic delocalized and nonergodic multifractal or localized) are observed, which leads to extensive (subextensive) scaling of EE (PR). Considering typical many-body eigenstates, we obtain above results that are further corroborated with the asymptotic dynamics. Additionally, a finite time secondary slow growth in EE is witnessed only for correlated case while for the uncorrelated case there exists only primary growth followed by the saturation. We believe that our findings from the typical many-body eigenstate would remain unaltered even in the weakly interacting limit.},

We show that for {$\alpha$} {$<$} 2 there exists a localization transition with renormalized disorder that depends logarithmically on the finite size of the system. The transition observed for {$\alpha$} {$>$} 2 does not need a rescaling in disorder strength. Most important, we find that even though the MBL transition for {$\alpha$} {$>$} 2 falls in the same universality class as that of the short-range models, the transition for {$\alpha$} {$<$} 2 belongs to a different universality class. Because of the intrinsic nature of the RSRG flow toward delocalization, MBL phase for {$\alpha$} {$>$} 2 might suffer an instability in the thermodynamic limit while the underlying systems support algebraic localization. Moreover, we verify these findings by inserting microscopic details to the RSRG scheme where we additionally find a more appropriate rescaling function for disorder strength; we indeed uncover a power-law scaling with a logarithmic correction and a distinctly different stretched exponential scaling for {$\alpha$} {$<$} 2 and {$\alpha$} {$>$} 2, respectively, by analyzing system with finite size.

The theory describes correctly---even without relying on the theory of local integrals of motion (LIOM)---the MBL phase in one dimension at strong disorder. It yields an explicit and quantitative picture of the spatial boundary between localized and ergodic systems. We provide numerical evidence for this picture. When the theory is taken to its extreme logical consequences, it predicts that the MBL phase is destabilised in the long time limit whenever (1) interactions decay slower than exponentially in d=1 and (2) always in d{$>$}1.

	abstract = {We numerically study both the avalanche instability and many-body resonances in strongly disordered spin chains exhibiting many-body localization (MBL). Finite-size systems behave like MBL within the MBL regimes, which we divide into the asymptotic MBL phase and the finite-size MBL regime; the latter regime is, however, thermal in the limit of large systems and long times. In both Floquet and Hamiltonian models, we identify some landmarks within the MBL regimes. Our first landmark is an estimate of where the MBL phase becomes unstable to avalanches, obtained by measuring the slowest relaxation rate of a finite chain coupled to an infinite bath at one end. Our estimates indicate that the actual MBL-to-thermal phase transition occurs much deeper in the MBL regimes than has been suggested by most previous studies. Our other landmarks involve systemwide many-body resonances: We find that the effective matrix elements producing eigenstates with systemwide many-body resonances are enormously broadly distributed. This broad distribution means that the onset of such resonances in typical samples occurs quite deep in the MBL regimes, and the first such resonances typically involve rare pairs of eigenstates that are farther apart in energy than the minimum gap. Thus we find that the resonance properties define two landmarks that divide the MBL regimes of finite-size systems into three subregimes: (i) at strongest randomness, typical samples do not have any eigenstates that are involved in systemwide many-body resonances; (ii) there is a substantial intermediate subregime where typical samples do have such resonances but the pair of eigenstates with the minimum spectral gap does not, so the size of the minimum gap agrees with expectations from Poisson statistics; and (iii) in the weaker randomness subregime, the minimum gap is larger than predicted by Poisson level statistics because it is involved in a many-body resonance and thus subject to level repulsion. Nevertheless, even in this third subregime, all but a vanishing fraction of eigenstates remain nonresonant and the system thus still appears MBL in most respects. Based on our estimates of the location of the avalanche instability, it might be that the MBL phase is only part of subregime (i) and the other subregimes are entirely in the thermal phase, even though they look localized in most respects, so are in the finite-size MBL regime.},

The model explains the decay timescale of mean autocorrelators, the functional form of the decay---a stretched exponential---and relates the value of the stretch expo- nent to the broad distribution of resonance timescales. The Jacobi method of matrix diagonalization provides numerical access to this distribution, as well as a conceptual framework for our analysis. The resonance model correctly predicts the stretch exponents for several models in the literature.

The further finding that the imbalance -- a global quantity measuring localization -- thermalizes over a time scale exponential both in disorder strength and system size is in agreement with these results.},

The goals are to understand how to precisely quantify the spreading of quantum information and how causality emerges in complex quantum systems. We introduce a general framework to study the dynamics of quantum information, including detection and decoding. We show that the dynamics of quantum information is closely related to operator dynamics in the Heisenberg picture, and, under certain circumstances, can be precisely quantified by the so-called out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC). The general behavior of the OTOC is discussed based on several toy models, including the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, random circuit models, and Brownian models, in which the OTOC is analytically tractable. We introduce numerical methods, including exact diagonalization and tensor network methods, to calculate the OTOC for generic quantum many-body systems. We also survey current experimental schemes for measuring the OTOC in various quantum simulators},

We investigate OTO correlators in the effective (``l-bit'') model of the MBL phase, and show that their amplitudes after dis- order averaging approach their long-time limits as power- laws of time. This power-law dynamics is due to dephas- ing caused by interactions between the localized operators that fall off exponentially with distance. The long-time lim- its of the OTO correlators are determined by the overlaps of the local operators with the conserved l-bits. We demon- strate numerically our results in the effective model and three other more ``realistic'' spin chain models. Furthermore, we extend our calculations to the thermal phase and find that for a time-independent Hamiltonian, the OTO correla- tors also appear to vanish as a power law at long time, per- haps due to coupling to conserved densities. In contrast, we find that in the thermal phase of a Floquet spin model with no conserved densities the OTO correlator decays exponen- tially at long times.},

	abstract = {Locality imposes stringent constraints on the spreading of information in nonrelativistic quantum systems, which is reminiscent of a "light-cone," a casual structure arising in their relativistic counterparts. Long-range interactions can potentially soften such constraints, allowing almost instantaneous long jumps of particles, thus defying causality. Since interactions decaying as a power-law with distance, \$r{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$, are ubiquitous in nature, it is pertinent to understand what is the fate of causality and information spreading in such systems. Using a numerically exact technique we address these questions by studying the out-of-time-order correlation function of a representative generic system in one-dimension. We show that while the interactions are long-range, their effect on information spreading is asymptotically negligible as long as \${\textbackslash}alpha{$>$}1\$. In this range we find a complex compound behavior, where after a short transient a fully local behavior emerges, yielding asymptotic "light-cones" virtually indistinguishable from "light-cones" in corresponding local models. The long-range nature of the interaction is only expressed in the power-law leaking of information from the "light-cone," with the same exponent as the exponent of the interaction, \${\textbackslash}alpha\$. Our results directly imply that all previously obtained rigorous bounds on information spreading in long-range interacting systems are not tight, and thus could be improved.},

	abstract = {Out-of-Time-Order Correlators (OTOCs) serve as a proxy for quantum information scrambling, which refers to the process where information stored locally disperses across the many-body degrees of freedom in a quantum system, rendering it inaccessible to local probes. Most experimental implementations of OTOCs to probe information scrambling rely on indirect measurements based on global observables, using techniques such as Loschmidt echoes and Multiple Quantum Coherences, via time reversal evolutions. In this article, we establish a direct connection between OTOCs with global and local observables in the context of NMR experiments, where the observable is the total magnetization of the system. We conduct a numerical analysis to quantify the differences in the evolution of both magnitudes, evaluating the excitation dynamics in spin ring systems with 8 to 16 spins, using a many-body Hamiltonian and long-range interactions. Our analysis decomposes the global echo into a sum of local echoes and cross-contributions, leading to local and global OTOCs. The results indicate that, after an initial transient period, local OTOCs determine the global ones. To confirm the equivalence, we observe that the difference between local and global OTOCs, as well as their fluctuations, becomes negligible as the system size increases. This behavior aligns with that observed in highly interacting or chaotic systems in several experiments.},

Besides the residual interaction with the environment, causing environment-induced decoherence, uncontrolled parameters in the system itself---disorder---remains as a substantial factor limiting the precision and thus the performance of devices. These pertur- bations may arise, for instance, due to imperfect sample production, stray fields, or finite accuracy of control electronics. Disorder-dressed quantum evolution means a unifying framework, based on quantum master equations, to analyze how these detrimental influences cause deviations from the desired system dynamics. This description may thus contribute to unveiling and mitigating disorder effects towards robust schemes. To demonstrate the broad scope of this framework, we evaluate two distinct scenarios: a central spin immersed in an isotropic spin bath, and a random mass Dirac particle. In the former scenario, we demonstrate how the disorder average reflects purity oscillations, indicating the time- and state-dependent severity of the disorder impact. In the latter scenario, we discuss disorder-induced backscattering and disorder-induced Zitterbewegung as consequences of the breakup of spin-momentum locking.},

Applying this interaction-based readout to oversqueezed, non-Gaussian states yields a Heisenberg scaling in phase sensitivity, which persists in the presence of detection noise as large as the quantum projection noise of an unentangled ensemble. Even in dissipative implementations---e.g., employing light-mediated interactions in an optical cavity or Rydberg dressing---the method significantly relaxes the detection resolution required for spectroscopy beyond the standard quantum limit.},

We support this result with analytical considerations using simple renormalization group arguments. Second, we inspect the case in which short-range interactions are added. By studying both the eigenstate properties of the Floquet Hamiltonian and the out-of-equilibrium dynamics in the interacting model, we provide evidence that ergodicity is restored at any driving frequencies.

In addition, we find the regime of slow relaxation is characterized by a sub-ballistic propagation of correlations that remained confined to short distances even at long times. To explain our findings we develop an analytic model based on decoupled clusters of interacting dipoles that goes beyond prior theoretical works and enables us to identify multiple relaxation timescales. Our findings can be relevant for a wide variety of quantum science platforms naturally featuring disordered dipolar interactions, including polar molecules, frozen Rydberg gases and NV centers.},

	abstract = {Making interacting atoms localize                            Disorder can stop the transport of noninteracting particles in its tracks. This phenomenon, known as Anderson localization, occurs in disordered solids, as well as photonic and cold atom settings. Interactions tend to make localization less likely, but disorder, interactions, and localization may coexist in the so-called many-body localized state. Schreiber               et al.               detect many-body localization in a one-dimensional optical lattice initially filled with atoms occupying alternating sites. Externally induced disorder and interactions prevented the system from evolving quickly to a state with a single atom on each site.

We experimentally observed this nonergodic evolution for interacting fermions in a one-dimensional quasirandom optical lattice and identified the MBL transition through the relaxation dynamics of an initially prepared charge density wave. For sufficiently weak disorder, the time evolution appears ergodic and thermalizing, erasing all initial ordering, whereas above a critical disorder strength, a substantial portion of the initial ordering persists. The critical disorder value shows a distinctive dependence on the interaction strength, which is in agreement with numerical simulations. Our experiment paves the way to further detailed studies of MBL, such as in noncorrelated disorder or higher dimensions.},

As an application of the replica expansion, we analyze an Ising spin 1/2 chain periodically kicked with magnetic field of strength \$h\$, which has both longitudinal and transverse components. We demonstrate that even away from the regime of high frequency driving, the heating rate is nonperturbative in the kick strength bounded from above by a stretched exponential: \$e{\textasciicircum}\{-\{{\textbackslash}rm const\}{\textbackslash},h{\textasciicircum}\{-1/2\}\}\$.

We explore the implications of NISQ platforms for many-body physics in a practical sense: we ask which \{{\textbackslash}it physical phenomena\}, in the domain of quantum statistical mechanics, they may realize more readily than traditional experimental platforms. As a particularly well-suited target, we identify discrete time crystals (DTCs), novel non-equilibrium states of matter that break time translation symmetry. These can only be realized in the intrinsically out-of-equilibrium setting of periodically driven quantum systems stabilized by disorder induced many-body localization. While precursors of the DTC have been observed across a variety of experimental platforms - ranging from trapped ions to nitrogen vacancy centers to NMR crystals - none have {\textbackslash}emph\{all\} the necessary ingredients for realizing a fully-fledged incarnation of this phase, and for detecting its signature long-range {\textbackslash}emph\{spatiotemporal order\}. We show that a new generation of quantum simulators can be programmed to realize the DTC phase and to experimentally detect its dynamical properties, a task requiring extensive capabilities for programmability, initialization and read-out. Specifically, the architecture of Google's Sycamore processor is a remarkably close match for the task at hand. We also discuss the effects of environmental decoherence, and how they can be distinguished from `internal' decoherence coming from closed-system thermalization dynamics. Already with existing technology and noise levels, we find that DTC spatiotemporal order would be observable over hundreds of periods, with parametric improvements to come as the hardware advances.},

	abstract = {Quantum simulation enables the experimental investigation of simplified physical models that capture the fundamental aspects of complex quantum many-body systems. In order to understand how interaction parameters impact the macroscopic properties of the system, it is essential to modify the Hamiltonian in a controlled fashion. This thesis presents novel approaches to perform tunable quantum simulations in an isolated many-body spin-1/2 system represented by dipolar interacting Rydberg atoms. These approaches are employed to study out-of-equilibrium dynamics in different regimes. The four major achievements are as follows: (i) Using various spin-encoding states within the Rydberg manifold, we realize XX, XXZ, and Ising models with spatial disorder and study magnetization relaxation dynamics. We identify a universal behavior that is independent of the microscopic properties and explained by the emergence of effective spin pairs. (ii) To introduce new effective interactions into the system, we employ a time-periodic drive to transform the natural dipolar interaction Hamiltonian into a desired target form. This method, known as Floquet engineering, is validated using both a gas of Rydberg atoms and individually trapped Rydberg atoms. We demonstrate its potential for tunable quantum simulation of Heisenberg spin models by altering symmetry and transport properties. (iii) Combining the methods developed in (i) and (ii), we devise and implement a time reversal protocol. The versatility of the approach is demonstrated by reversing quantum dynamics for a variety of many-body Hamiltonian with tunable symmetry, which we realize through Floquet engineering. (iv) Beyond experimental demonstration, we propose alternative approaches to engineer many-body systems, including a new approach to realize time-reversal operations, and an approach for introducing mobile dopants into Ryderg spin systems. The Hamiltonian engineering methods can be directly applied to further study the extend to which the emergence of effective spin pairs is the common feature of disordered quantum spin systems. In general, engineering a wide range of Hamiltonians opens up several new opportunities for investigating fields that range from spin transport and spin glasses to quantum thermalization.},

We discuss key features of many-body localization (MBL) and review a phenomenology of the MBL phase.

The spreading of the avalanche may be modeled and numerically studied in finite one-dimensional MBL systems by weakly coupling an infinite-temperature bath to one end of the system. We find that the avalanche spreads primarily via strong many-body resonances between rare near-resonant eigenstates of the closed system.

The clusters of `on' bits vary significantly between eigenstates of the               same               sample, which provides evidence for a heterogeneous discontinuous transition out of the localized phase in single-site observables. We obtain these results by perturbative mapping to bond percolation on the hypercube at small J  and by  numerical exact diagonalization of the full many-body system. Our results support the arguments that the MBL phase is unstable in systems with short-range interactions and quenched randomness in dimensions d that are high but finite.

Our scheme focuses on the dichotomy of MBL versus validity of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We show that a few natural assumptions imply that the system is localized with probability one at criticality. On the ergodic side, delocalization is induced by a quantum avalanche seeded by large ergodic spots, whose size diverges at the transition. On the MBL side, the typical localization length tends to the inverse of the maximal entropy density at the transition, but there is a divergent length scale related to the response to an inclusion of large ergodic spots. A mean-field approximation analytically illustrates these results and predicts a power-law distribution for thermal inclusions at criticality.},

This system models the effects of rare low-disorder regions on many-body localized chains. Above a threshold value of the mean localization length, the seed causes runaway thermalization in which a finite fraction of the orbitals are absorbed into a thermal bubble. This ``partially avalanched'' regime provides a simple example of a delocalized, nonergodic dynamical phase. We derive the hierarchy of length scales necessary for typical samples to exhibit the avalanche instability, and show that the required seed size diverges at the avalanche threshold. We introduce a dimensionless statistic that measures the effective size of the thermal bubble, and use it to numerically confirm the predictions of avalanche theory in the Anderson chain at infinite temperature},

	abstract = {Recent theoretical and numerical evidence suggests that localization can survive in disordered many-body systems with very high energy density, provided that interactions are sufficiently weak. Stronger interactions can destroy localization, leading to a so-called many-body localization transition. This dynamical phase transition is relevant to questions of thermalization in extended quantum systems far from the zero-temperature limit. It separates a many-body localized phase, in which localization prevents transport and thermalization, from a conducting ("ergodic") phase in which the usual assumptions of quantum statistical mechanics hold. Here, we present numerical evidence that many-body localization also occurs in models without disorder but rather a quasiperiodic potential. In one dimension, these systems already have a single-particle localization transition, and we show that this transition becomes a many-body localization transition upon the introduction of interactions. We also comment on possible relevance of our results to experimental studies of many-body dynamics of cold atoms and non-linear light in quasiperiodic potentials.},

Such phases can show topological and symmetry breaking order in their ground and excited states, but they may also belong to an fanomalous localized topological phase (ALT phase). All eigenstates in an ALT phase are trivial, in that they can be deformed to product states, but the entire Hamiltonian cannot be deformed to a trivial localized model without going through a delocalization transition. Using a correspondence between MBL phases with short-ranged entanglement and locality preserving unitaries -- called quantum cellular automata (QCA) -- we reduce the classification of ALT phases to that of QCA. This method extends to periodically (Floquet) and quasiperiodically driven ALT phases, and captures anomalous Floquet phases within the same framework as static phases. The QCA framework further generalizes to include symmetry-enriched ALT phases (SALT phases), and provides a large class of soluble models suitable for realization in quantum simulators. In systematizing the study of ALT phases, we both greatly extend the classification of interacting nonequilibrium systems and clarify a confusion in the literature which implicitly equates nontrivial Hamiltonians with nontrivial ground states.},

Our first result provides knowledge of the quantum order by disorder effect of the                                                   S                   =                   1                   /                   2                                               system, which is programmable in a quantum simulator composed of circular Rydberg atoms in the triangular optical lattice with a controllable diagonal anisotropy. When the numbers of up spins and down spins are equal, a set of subextensive degenerate ground states is present in the classical limit, composed of continuous strings whose configuration enjoys a large degree of freedom. Among all possible configurations, we focus on the stripe (up and down spins aligning straightly) and kinked (up and down spins forming zigzag spin chains) patterns. Adopting the the real space perturbation theory, we estimate the leading order energy correction when the nearest-neighbor spin exchange coupling,                                J                              , is considered, and the overall model becomes an effective                                                   X                   X                   Z                                               model with a spatial anisotropy. Our calculation demonstrates a lifting of the degeneracy, favoring the stripe configuration. When                                J                              becomes larger, we adopt the infinite projected entangled-pair state (iPEPS) and numerically check the effect of degeneracy lifting. The iPEPS results show that even when the spin exchange coupling is strong the stripe pattern is still favored. Next, we study the dipolar bosonic model with tilted polar angle which can be realized through a quantum simulator composed of cold atomic gas with dipole-dipole interaction in an optical lattice. By placing the atoms in a triangular lattice and tilting the polar angle, the diagonal anisotropy can also be realized in the bosonic system. With our cluster mean-field theory calculation, we provide various phase diagrams with different tilted angles, showing the abundant underlying phases including the supersolid. Our proposal indicates realizable scenarios through quantum simulators in studying the quantum effect as well as extraordinary phases. We believe that our results indicated here can also become a good benchmark for two-dimensional quantum simulators.

One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. 3. There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. We introduce the Julia programming language and its design---a dance between special- ization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming.

We show that the Rydberg Ising model in the large detuning regime can be mapped to a generalized folded XXZ model featuring a strongly fragmented Hilbert space. The emergent Hamiltonian, however, displays distinct time scales for the transport of a magnon and a hole excitation. This interesting property facilitates a continuous tuning of the Krylov-subspace ergodicity, from the integrable regime, to the Krylov-restricted thermal phase, and eventually to the statistical bubble localization region. By further introducing nonlocal interactions, we find that both the fragmentation behavior and the ergodicity of the Krylov subspace can be significantly enriched. We also examine the role of atomic position disorders and identify a symmetry-selective many-body localization transition. We demonstrate that these phenomena manifest themselves in quench dynamics, which can be readily probed in state-of-the-art Rydberg array setups.},

However, little is known about how thermalization occurs in situations where the constraints are not exact. To study this, we consider a situation in which a fragmented 1d chain with pair-flip constraints is coupled to a thermal bath at its boundary. For product states quenched under Hamiltonian dynamics, we numerically observe an exponentially long thermalization time, manifested in both entanglement dynamics and the relaxation of local observables. To understand this, we study an analogous model of random unitary circuit dynamics, where we rigorously prove that the thermalization time scales exponentially with system size. Slow thermalization in this model is shown to be a consequence of strong bottlenecks in configuration space, demonstrating a new way of producing anomalously slow thermalization dynamics.},
