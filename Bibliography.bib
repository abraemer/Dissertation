Our numerical analysis provides evidence that even a small ergodic grain consisting of only 3 qubits can delocalize a localized chain, as soon as the localization length exceeds a critical value separating localized and extended regimes of the whole system. We present a simple theory, consistent with the arguments in [Phys. Rev. B 95, 155129 (2017)], that assumes a system to be locally ergodic unless the local relaxation time, determined by Fermi's Golden Rule, is larger than the inverse level spacing. This theory predicts a critical value for the localization length that is perfectly consistent with our numerical calculations. We analyze in detail the behavior of local operators inside and outside the ergodic grain, and find excellent agreement of numerics and theory.},

The time evolution of simple (unentangled) initial states is studied numerically for a system of interacting spinless fermions in one dimension described by the random-field XXZ Hamiltonian. Interactions induce a dramatic change in the propagation of entanglement and a smaller change in the propagation of particles. For even weak interactions, when the system is thought to be in a many-body localized phase, entanglement shows neither localized nor diffusive behavior but grows without limit in an infinite system: interactions act as a singular perturbation on the localized state with no interactions. The significance for proposed atomic experiments is that local measurements will show a large but non-thermal entropy in the many-body localized state. This entropy develops slowly (approximately logarithmically) over a diverging time scale as in glassy systems.},

We prove, with virtually full generality, that reaching equilibrium is a universal property of quantum systems: Almost any subsystem in interaction with a large enough bath will reach an equilibrium state and remain close to it for almost all times.

Berry's conjecture is expected to hold only if the corresponding classical system is chaotic, and essentially states that the energy eigenfunctions behave as if they were gaussian random variables. We review the existing evidence, and show that previously neglected effects substantially strengthen the case for Berry's conjecture. We study a rarefied hard-sphere gas as an explicit example of a many-body system which is known to be classically chaotic, and show that an energy eigenstate which obeys Berry's conjecture predicts a Maxwell--Boltzmann, Bose--Einstein, or Fermi--Dirac distribution for the momentum of each constituent particle, depending on whether the wave functions are taken to be nonsymmetric, completely symmetric, or completely antisymmetric functions of the positions of the particles. We call this phenomenon eigenstate thermalization. We show that a generic initial state will approach thermal equilibrium at least as fast as O(h{\textasciimacron}/∆)t-1, where ∆ is the uncertainty in the total energy of the gas. This result holds for an individual initial state; in contrast to the classical theory, no averaging over an ensemble of initial states is needed. We argue that these results constitute a new foundation for quantum statistical mechanics.},

	abstract = {Time dynamics of isolated many-body quantum systems has long been an elusive subject. Very recently, however, meaningful experimental studies of the problem have finally become possible, stimulating theoretical interest as well. Progress in this field is perhaps most urgently needed in the foundations of quantum statistical mechanics. This is so because in generic isolated systems, one expects nonequilibrium dynamics on its own to result in thermalization: a relaxation to states where the values of macroscopic quantities are stationary, universal with respect to widely differing initial conditions, and predictable through the time-tested recipe of statistical mechanics. However, it is not obvious what feature of many-body quantum mechanics makes quantum thermalization possible, in a sense analogous to that in which dynamical chaos makes classical thermalization possible. For example, dynamical chaos itself cannot occur in an isolated quantum system, where time evolution is linear and the spectrum is discrete. Underscoring that new rules could apply in this case, some recent studies even suggested that statistical mechanics may give wrong predictions for the outcomes of relaxation in such systems. Here we demonstrate that an isolated generic quantum many-body system does in fact relax to a state well-described by the standard statistical mechanical prescription. Moreover, we show that time evolution itself plays a merely auxiliary role in relaxation and that thermalization happens instead at the level of individual eigenstates, as first proposed by J.M. Deutsch and M. Srednicki. A striking consequence of this eigenstate thermalization scenario is that the knowledge of a single many-body eigenstate suffices to compute thermal averages-any eigenstate in the microcanonical energy window will do, as they all give the same result.},

The reasons for why it works in so many cases are rooted in the early work of Wigner on random matrix theory and our understanding of quantum chaos. The ETH has now been studied extensively by both analytic and numerical means, and applied to a number of physical situations ranging from black hole physics to condensed matter systems. It has recently become the focus of a number of experiments in highly isolated systems. Current theoretical work also focuses on where the ETH breaks down leading to new interesting phenomena. This review of the ETH takes a somewhat intuitive approach as to why it works and how this informs our understanding of many body quantum states.},

If V(r) decreases with the distance r slower than 1/r{\textasciicircum}d in a d-dimensional system then all excitations are delocalized at arbitrarily strong disordering, due to the resonant interaction of far separated quantum states (Fig. 1). At finite temperature T{$>$}0 the density of excitations is finite and they can influence each other by means of their interaction. Many body excitations involving simultaneous transitions of several single particle excitations create additional channels for energy delocalization and transport. Here we show that if the interaction of excitations decreases with the distance slower than 1/R{\textasciicircum}(2d) then excitations are delocalized at finite temperature irrespectively to disordering. This delocalization results in the finite decoherence rate in the ensemble of interacting spins 1/2 representing the model of quantum computer, thus restricting the quantum hardware performance. It also leads to the energy and particle delocalization and transport at finite temperature in various physical systems including doped semiconductors, despite of the full localization of electrons at zero temperature.},

Particle-hole excitations built on localized electron states are viewed as two-level systems randomly distributed in space and energy and coupled due to electron-electron interaction. A small fraction of these states form resonant pairs that in turn build a complex network allowing for energy propaga- tion. We identify the character of energy transport through this network and evaluate the thermal conductivity. For physically relevant cases of 2D and 3D spin systems with 1/r 3 dipole-dipole in- teraction (originating from the conventional 1/r Coulomb interaction between electrons), the found thermal conductivity {$\kappa$} scales with temperature as {$\kappa$} {$\propto$} T 3 and {$\kappa$} {$\propto$} T 4/3 , respectively.

	abstract = {Many-body localization in an XY model with a long-range interaction is investigated. We show that in the regime of a high strength of disordering compared to the interaction an off-resonant flip-flop spin-spin interaction (hopping) generates the effective Ising interactions of spins in the third order of perturbation theory in a hopping. The combination of hopping and induced Ising interactions for the power-law distance dependent hopping V (R) {$\propto$} R -{$\alpha$} always leads to the localization breakdown in a thermodynamic limit of an infinite system at {$\alpha$} {$<$} 3d/2 where d is a system dimension. The delocalization takes place due to the induced Ising interactions U (R) {$\propto$} R -2{$\alpha$} of ``extended'' resonant pairs. This prediction is consistent with the numerical finite size scaling in one-dimensional systems. Many-body localization in an XY model is more stable with respect to the long- range interaction compared to a many-body problem with similar Ising and Heisenberg interactions requiring {$\alpha$} ⩾ 2d which makes the practical implementations of this model more attractive for quantum information applications. The full summary of dimension constraints and localization threshold size dependencies for many- body localization in the case of combined Ising and hopping interactions is obtained using this and previous work and it is the subject for the future experimental verification using cold atomic systems.},

	abstract = {Quantum information theoretical measures are useful tools for characterizing quantum dynamical phases. However, employing them to study excited states of random spin systems is a challenging problem. Here, we report results for the entanglement entropy (EE) scaling of excited eigenstates of random XX antiferromagnetic spin chains with long-range (LR) interactions decaying as a power law with distance with exponent \${\textbackslash}alpha\$. To this end, we extend the real-space renormalization group technique for excited states (RSRG-X) to solve this problem with LR interaction. For comparison, we perform numerical exact diagonalization (ED) calculations. From the distribution of energy level spacings, as obtained by ED for up to \$N{\textbackslash}sim 18\$ spins, we find indications of a delocalization transition at \${\textbackslash}alpha\_c {\textbackslash}approx 1\$ in the middle of the energy spectrum. With RSRG-X and ED, we show that for \${\textbackslash}alpha{$>\backslash$}alpha{\textasciicircum}*\$ the entanglement entropy (EE) of excited eigenstates retains a logarithmic divergence similar to the one observed for the ground state of the same model, while for \${\textbackslash}alpha{$<\backslash$}alpha{\textasciicircum}*\$ EE displays an algebraic growth with the subsystem size \$l\$, \$S\_l{\textbackslash}sim l{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}beta\}\$, with \$0{$<\backslash$}beta{$<$}1\$. We find that \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textasciicircum}* {\textbackslash}approx 1\$ coincides with the delocalization transition \${\textbackslash}alpha\_c\$ in the middle of the many-body spectrum. An interpretation of these results based on the structure of the RG rules is proposed, which is due to \{{\textbackslash}it rainbow\} proliferation for very long-range interactions \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash}ll 1\$. We also investigate the effective temperature dependence of the EE allowing us to study the half-chain entanglement entropy of eigenstates at different energy densities, where we find that the crossover in EE occurs at \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textasciicircum}* {$<$} 1\$.},

We report on the observation of anomalous relaxation dynamics in an isolated XXZ quantum spin system realized by an ultracold gas of atoms initially prepared in a superposition of two-different Rydberg states. The total magnetization is found to exhibit sub-exponential relaxation analogous to classical glassy dynamics, but in the quantum case this relaxation originates from the build-up of non-classical correlations. In both experiment and semi-classical simulations, we find the evolution towards a randomized state is independent of the strength of disorder up to a critical value. This hints towards a unifying description of relaxation dynamics in disordered isolated quantum systems, analogous to the generalization of statistical mechanics to out-of-equilibrium scenarios in classical spin glasses.},

Here we show that this law describes relaxation quite generically in closed (executing Schr{\textbackslash}"\{o\}dinger dynamics), interacting disordered many-body systems across a range of system sizes using interaction range and disorder strength as primary tuning parameters. This we observe for both time-independent and periodically driven (Floquet) systems. Finite-size analysis indicates the persistence of this non-thermal relaxation regime in the thermodynamic limit thus defining a distinct dynamical regime. This regime exhibits a peak in the time-scale of the perceptible relaxation, upon crossing over from weak to strong disorder. We provide a simple picture of this behavior, which naturally accounts for its general occurrence. Formation of spin-glass -- one of the possible mechanisms for stretched relaxation appears incidental to the occurrence of Kohlrausch law in our context. Finally, we provide a simple non-Hermitian Hamiltonian formulation for the dynamics of a single spin embedded in the disordered chain. This provides an analytical formula that captures not only the Kohlrausch relaxation of the disorder averaged auto-correlation but also captures the largely diverse dynamics of an arbitrary target spin in the system. Our work hence also provides a concrete quantification of the ``pre-thermal slowness" in many-body disordered system.},

This method is based on general- ization of the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) to a higher dimensional phase space, where phase space variables are associated with a complete set of quantum operators spanning finite size clusters. The method becomes asymptotically exact with the increasing cluster size. The crucial feature of TWA is fluctuating initial conditions, which we approximate by a Gaussian distribution. We show that such fluctuations dramatically in- crease accuracy of TWA over traditional cluster mean field approximations. In this way we can treat on equal footing quantum and thermal fluctuations as well as compute entanglement and various equal and non-equal time correlation functions. The main limitation of the method is exponential scaling of the phase space dimen- sionality with the cluster size, which can be significantly reduced by using the language of Schwinger bosons and can likely be further reduced by truncating the local Hilbert space variables. We demonstrate the power of this method analyzing dynamics in various spin chains with and without disorder and show that we can cap- ture such phenomena as long time hydrodynamic relaxation, many-body localization and the ballistic spread of entanglement.},
