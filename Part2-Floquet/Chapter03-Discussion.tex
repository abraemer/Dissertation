\chapter{Outlook: Observation of a time crystal in the Rydberg Experiment?}
Novel stabilization mechanism?

\texttt{rydberg-pair-timecrystal.jl}
Replace interacting Hamiltonian with Pair model. Then dynamics are effectively average over pair  distribution. Each pair is not stable but has some lifetime depending on its interaction strength. Since distribution is very broad there is some phase-wrapping going on which leads to a slow decay. So pair model predicts not a stable time crystal but an anomalously slow decay (stretched exponential again?).
