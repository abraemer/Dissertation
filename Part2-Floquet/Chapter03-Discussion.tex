\chapter{Outlook: Observation of a time crystal in the Rydberg Experiment?}
Novel stabilization mechanisms due to disorder?

Preliminary results show a time crystalline signature in the Rydberg experiment but pure pair model does not find this. However there also random on-site potentials due to van-der Waals interactions, these 

\texttt{rydberg-pair-timecrystal.jl}
Replace interacting Hamiltonian with Pair model. Then dynamics are effectively average over pair  distribution. Each pair is not stable but has some lifetime depending on its interaction strength. Since distribution is very broad there is some phase-wrapping going on which leads to a slow decay. So pair model predicts not a stable time crystal but an anomalously slow decay (stretched exponential again?).
