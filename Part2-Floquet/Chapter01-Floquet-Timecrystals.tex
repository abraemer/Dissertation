\chapter{Concepts: Periodically driven systems and time crystals}\label{ch:introduction-floquet}

The second major part of the thesis switches gear and focuses on the effects of spatial inhomogeneities in Floquet systems, i.e. systems that undergo periodic driving. While there has been a lot of attention in the literature for Floquet systems with disorder in the interactions already, most studies focus on the prototypical MBL model. Thus, the consequences of pair localization or influence of disorder in the drive remain largely unstudied. Before, we explore these in the following chapters, first we give a brief overview of the relevant concepts from the field of Floquet systems. For a more in-depth review, we refer the interested reader to e.g.~\cite{eckardtColloquiumAtomicQuantum2017}. Subsequently, we also cover the basics of thermalization in Floquet systems (see e.g.~\cite{moriThermalizationPrethermalizationIsolated2018} for more context) and then briefly summarize the phenomenon of time crystals in particular~\cite{elseFloquetTimeCrystals2016,khemaniBriefHistoryTime2019,elseDiscreteTimeCrystals2020a}.

\section{Introduction to Floquet systems}

Starting with the basics, a Floquet system is a system governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian $H(t)$ with period $T$, i.e. 
\begin{equation}
	H(t) = H(T+t)\quad.
\end{equation}
The time evolution operator evolving the initial state to some time $t$ reads formally
\begin{equation}
	U(t) = \mathcal{T}\exp(-i\int_0^t\!\mathrm{d}t'H(t'))
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{T}\exp$ is the time-ordered exponential.
Exploiting the periodicity, we can split the time evolution operator
\begin{align}
	U(t) &= \mathcal{T}\exp(-i\int_0^t\!\mathrm{d}t'H(t'))\\
	&= U(t-nT)\left[\mathcal{T}\exp(-i\int_0^T\!\mathrm{d}t'H(t'))\right]^n\\
	&= U(t-nT) (U_F)^n
\end{align}
into $n$ applications of an operator $U_F$, which advances the state a full cycle, and a \emph{micromotion} part $U(t-nT)$ governing the dynamics within a cycle. Restricting observation to \emph{stroboscopic} times where $t=nT$, we can understand the dynamics by considering only the time-independent operator
\begin{equation}
	U_F = \mathcal{T}\exp(-i\int_0^T\!\mathrm{d}t'H(t')) \equiv \exp(-iTH_F)
\end{equation}
where $H_F$ is an effective, time-independent Hamiltonian, called \emph{Floquet Hamiltonian}. However, there are some difficulties with this approach: First of all, $H_F$ is ill-defined because its eigenvalues are only defined $\mathrm{mod} \frac{2\pi}{T}$. Hence, they are usually called \emph{quasienergies}. Secondly, $H_F$ is generally infeasible to calculate exactly and might be grossly non-local. Nonetheless, in many cases one can find approximations to $H_F$ that sufficiently describe the system's dynamics.

In the following, we restrict the discussion to a typical setup where $H(t)$ consists of two parts: A part where the system undergoes dynamics according to its interactions $H_{int}$ and another part where the drive $H_{drive}$ is active and no other internal dynamics takes place:
\begin{align}
	H(t) &= \begin{cases}
		H_{int} & 0 \leq t < t_{int}\\
		H_{drive} & t_{int} \leq t < T=t_{int}+t_{d}
	\end{cases}\\
\Rightarrow\quad U_F &= \exp\left(-it_{d}H_{drive}\right)\exp\left(-it_{int}H_{int}\right) \label{eq:simple-floquet}
\end{align}
A simple way of approximating such a $H_F$ is through the \emph{Magnus expansion}, which is guaranteed to converge in the \emph{high frequency limit}, i.e. if $t_{int}\norm{H_{int}}+t_{d}\norm{H_{drive}} \ll \pi $~\cite{blanesMagnusExpansionIts2009}. In this simple case, it amounts to applying the well-known Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula to \autoref{eq:simple-floquet}. The first few terms are given by:
\begin{align}
	H_F &= \sum_k H_F^{(k)}\\
	H_F^{(1)} &= \frac{1}{T}\left(t_{int} H_{int} + t_{d}H_{drive}\right)\\
	H_F^{(2)} &= \frac{t_{d}t_{int}}{2T} \left[H_{drive}, H_{int}\right]
\end{align}
Apart from being simple to calculate in most cases, the Magnus expansion is hermitian in every order and preserves the symmetries of the Floquet operator $U_F$. Additionally, for models featuring only two-body terms, the occuring operators only grow by a single site per order. This features make the Magnus expansion central to many approaches to Floquet systems.

In cases where one of the participating operators is not small, there exists another approach to approximate $H_F$ with similar properties which is based on a replica resummation trick~\cite{vajnaReplicaResummationBakerCampbellHausdorff2018}.

\section{Thermalization in Floquet systems}

The Floquet Hamiltonian $H_F$ allows to understand the dynamics of Floquet systems in the same terms as in closed quantum systems. So when viewed at stroboscopic times, the system thermalizes in accordance to $H_F$. 
However, when considering longer and longer times, higher and higher orders of the Magnus expansion become relevant leading to a slow drift of the equilibrium state. This phenomenon is called \emph{Floquet prethermalization}~\cite{moriThermalizationPrethermalizationIsolated2018}.
The general physical intuition is that the drive pumps energy into the system heating it up until it reaches a featureless infinite temperature state\cite{dalessioLongtimeBehaviorIsolated2014,bukovUniversalHighfrequencyBehavior2015}. It has been shown that the timescale this heating occurs on grows exponentially with the driving frequency $\omega\propto T^{-1}$~\cite{kuwaharaFloquetMagnusTheory2016,abaninRigorousTheoryManyBody2017}.

However, similar to closed systems, there are exceptions to this rule.
For example, it has been shown that an interaction Hamiltonian featuring MBL can preserve the localization even under driving provided the driving frequency is sufficiently large~\cite{abaninTheoryManybodyLocalization2016,burauFateAlgebraicManybody2021,sierantStabilityManybodyLocalization2023}.
This Floquet MBL is just one example of large variety of phenomena related to the late and intermediate time behavior of periodically driven systems.  

\section{Time crystals}
An interesting consequence of the absence of thermalization (e.g. due to Floquet MBL) is the existence of out-of-equilibrium phases of matter exhibiting new, exotic properties. One such feature is the existence of states that \emph{spontaneously break time translation symmetry} which is ruled out in equilibrium phases~\cite{watanabeAbsenceQuantumTime2015} but can be observed in Floquet systems~\cite{vonkeyserlingkAbsoluteStabilitySpatiotemporal2016,elsePrethermalPhasesMatter2017,khemaniBriefHistoryTime2019,elseDiscreteTimeCrystals2020a}. Such a state is dubbed \emph{time crystal} in analogy to regular crystals that spontaneously break spatial translation symmetry. A prototypical example of a system with time crystalline behavior~\cite{elseFloquetTimeCrystals2016,elseDiscreteTimeCrystals2020a} is a driven MBL system, where the LIOMs $\tau_z^{(i)}\approx\sigma_z^{(i)}$ are close to $\sigma_z$ and the drive approximately flips the system about its $x$-axis, i.e.
\begin{align}
	H_{int} &= \sum_i h_i \tau_z^{(i)} + \sum_{ij} J_{ij}\tau_z^{(i)}\tau_z^{(j)}+\ldots\\
	H_{d}&=\exp\left[i(1-\epsilon)\pi\sum_i \sigma_x^{(i)}\right].
\end{align}
It is easy to see that at $\epsilon=0$, all the $\sigma_z^{(i)}$ are quasi-conserved in magnitude but switch their sign every period because $\sigma_x \sigma_z \sigma_x = -\tau_z$. Thus, we can write
\begin{equation}
	U_F = X\exp(-i\sum_{ij} J_{ij}\tau_z^{(i)}\tau_z^{(j)} + \ldots )
\end{equation}
where $X\propto\prod_i \sigma_x$ and the exponential contains only the terms commuting with $X$. This means any $z$-basis state is (close to) an eigenstate of $U_F^2$ but not of $U_F$, which is the realization of time translation symmetry-breaking~\cite{elseFloquetTimeCrystals2016}. The dynamics of such a state show a \emph{subharmonic response} because they oscillate with an integer multiple of the system's driving frequency.

Crucially, this phenomenon is stable to perturbations! Leaving the exactly soluble point at $\epsilon=0$, all of these features persist in a finite region of the parameter space. Thus, time crystals truly represent an out-of-equilibrium phase of matter. Apart from the prototypical model above, there are many different scenarios where they can arise~\cite{khemaniBriefHistoryTime2019,elseDiscreteTimeCrystals2020a} and they have also been studied experimentally on a variety of platforms (e.g.~\cite{choiObservationDiscreteTimecrystalline2017,miTimeCrystallineEigenstateOrder2021,ippolitiManybodyPhysicsNISQ2021,randallManybodyLocalizedDiscrete2021}).
