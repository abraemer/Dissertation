\chapter{Concepts: time crystals in Floquet systems}\label{ch:introduction-floquet}

The second part of the thesis, switches gear and focus on the effects of spatial inhomogeneity in Floquet system, i.e. systems that undergo periodic driving. While there has been a lot of attention already for Floquet systems with disorder in the interaction part of the cycle, the influence of disorder in the drive remains largely unstudied. Before, we explore this in the following chapters, here we give a brief overview of the relevant concepts from the field of Floquet systems.

\section{Floquet systems}
review~\cite{eckardtColloquiumAtomicQuantum2017}

time-dependent, periodic Hamiltonian -> at stroboscopic times can be modelled by time-independent Hamiltonian which is not unique but eigenenergies only defined up to mod $2pi/T$

$H_F$ can in general not be calculated -> magnus expansion (convergence in high frequency limit). 


\section{Thermalization in Floquet systems}

Thermalization to $H_F$ similar to closed system.

Usually driving deposits energy into the system causing heating towards an infinite temperature state \cite{dalessioLongtimeBehaviorIsolated2014,bukovUniversalHighfrequencyBehavior2015}.

Prethermalization~\cite{moriThermalizationPrethermalizationIsolated2018}: In high frequency limit, there is a meta stable state given by Magnus expansion. When breakdown occurs, the systems continues heating. At high frequency, heating time grows exponentially~\cite{kuwaharaFloquetMagnusTheory2016,abaninRigorousTheoryManyBody2017,moriThermalizationPrethermalizationIsolated2018}

\section{Time crystals}

MBL can survive driving \cite{abaninTheoryManybodyLocalization2016,burauFateAlgebraicManybody2021,sierantStabilityManybodyLocalization2023}

driving can induce MBL \cite{choiDynamicallyInducedManybody2018}

time crystal \cite{vonkeyserlingkAbsoluteStabilitySpatiotemporal2016,elsePrethermalPhasesMatter2017}, review~\cite{khemaniBriefHistoryTime2019,elseDiscreteTimeCrystals2020a}
experiment~\cite{choiObservationDiscreteTimecrystalline2017}

 - \emph{phase}, i.e. not fine-tuned, extended parameter region
