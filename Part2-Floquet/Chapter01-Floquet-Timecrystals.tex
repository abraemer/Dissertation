\chapter{Concepts: time crystals in Floquet systems}\label{ch:introduction-floquet}



\section{Floquet systems}

Floquet systems are periodically driven systems

Magnus expansion (high frequency limit)?

\section{Thermalization in Floquet systems}

Usually driving deposits energy into the system causing heating towards an infinite temperature state.

\section{Time crystals}
