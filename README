# Dissertation title
My dissertation.

This uses the [classicthesis](https://ctan.org/pkg/classicthesis) template.

# newpax
To keep links inside the embedded papers intact, you need to use newpax (and `lualatex`). First generate for each paper to be inserted the corresponding `.newpax` file. See in `papers` subdirectory how this is done. Due to a ~~bug~~[unintentional feature](https://github.com/u-fischer/newpax/issues/19), all the `.pdf` and `.newpax` need to be in the root directory.
