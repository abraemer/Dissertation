\chapter{Evidence of pair localization in the dynamics of Rydberg spins}\label{ch:experimental-pairs}

In this chapter, we apply the previously derived effective model of pairs interpret experimental results from a Rydberg-based quantum simulator. While the experiment is limited to global control and readout, we make great use of its ability to implement Heisenberg models with different anisotropy and various density (which translates to disorder strength).

We find the pair model to yield  an excellent agreement with the observed behavior explaining both the relaxation dynamics and rescaling thereof~\cite{franzObservationAnisotropyindependentMagnetization2024} as well as the dependence of the steady state magnetization on the strength of the transverse field~\cite{franzEmergentPairLocalization2024}.


\section{Anisotropy-independent relaxation dynamics}\label{sec:universal-dynamics}
In this paper, we utilize the ability of the Rydberg quantum simulator to implement XX, XXZ and Ising models to measure the relaxation of the $x$-magnetization when starting from a fully magnetized state. For disordered Ising models prior work has shown the relaxation to follow a stretched exponential form well-known from spin glasses~\cite{breyStretchedExponentialDecay1993,signolesGlassyDynamicsDisordered2021,schultzenGlassyQuantumDynamics2022,schultzenSemiclassicalSimulationsPredict2022}. It has been conjectured that this type of slow, hierarchical relaxation is a common feature of strongly disordered quantum systems~\cite{haldarSlowDynamicsKohlrausch2023}.

Indeed we find that for all three models the relaxation curves are fitted well by stretched exponentials. Moreover, we also find a scaling law for the characteristic decay time scale which hints at a common origin of the relaxation. This mechanism is explained by the pair model, which yields that for all three models the relaxation is caused essentially by oscillations of the magnetization of pairs. Since each pair has a different oscillation frequency these individual oscillations dephase and thus cause the total magnetization to decay. From the parameter dependence of these pair oscillations, we recover the characteristic timescale for the global magnetization's decay. This is a clear indicator of an effective pair localization at least for experimentally relevant timescales.

\section{Emergent pair localization}
Another way of validating the pair model is the comparison of the same model at different disorder strengths. This can be realized in a Rydberg based quantum simulator by tuning the systems' density as explained in \autoref{sec:Rydberg-experiment}.

In the following~\cite{franzEmergentPairLocalization2024}, we again use the $x$-magnetization as observable and track its steady-state value with respect to an external magnetic field aligned in $x$-direction as well. We find a clear qualitative difference between weak and strong disorder at small external fields: The strongly disordered system responds much stronger to the field, i.e. the steady-state magnetization grows very fast with increasing field strength, than the weakly disordered on. This leads to a sharp cusp-like curve, which we show to be incompatible with a thermal state. Instead, we find that a pair-based effective model reproduces this feature and can also match the full measurement data closely.
Conversely, at weak disorder, i.e. high density, the steady-state magnetization behaves quite different. At weak field, the curve is very round which is reproduced nicely using a thermal description.

This experiment provides direct evidence for a pair localization transition. However, it is possible that this is a prethermal regime only and the signature vanishes at much later times. Testing for this experimentally will of course be very hard, if not impossible, depending on the timescale of this final relaxation.

Following the publication, we present an alternative to the mean-field model in \autoref{sec:cusp-round-sharp}. This conceptually simpler model allows for analytical computation of both the presumably thermal and pair localized magnetization curves. Thus, the qualitative difference between weak and strong disorder is tracked back to a qualitative difference of the distribution of relevant couplings. 
While this model is not as quantitative as the mean-field model contained in the publication, it nonetheless has the same qualitative features and thus highlights the physical origin of the behavior at weak field more directly.

\subsection{Origin of the cusp-like signature}\label{sec:cusp-round-sharp}
To derive the qualitative behavior of the steady-state magnetization $\braket[1]{M(\Omega)}$ with respect to external field $\Omega$, we use a simple two-component model where each spin is either fully polarized or fully demagnetized. We assume that a spin's final state depends solely on the ratio of the strongest coupling $J$ towards another spin and the strength of the external field $\Omega$. If the field dominates, i.e. $|\Omega| > J$, the spin stays polarized as it is locked by the field. Conversely, if the coupling dominates, i.e. $|\Omega| < J$, then the interactions lead to depolarization and the spin loses its magnetization. Thus, in this simplified model, the only quantity determining the steady-state magnetization is the distribution of relevant couplings $P(J)$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Cusp-simple-model-magnetization}
	\braket[1]{M(\Omega)} = \frac{1}{2}\int_0^{|\Omega|}\!\mathrm{d}J P(J)
\end{equation}

In the regime of weak disorder, it only natural to assume that the most relevant coupling for a spin is given by its strongest coupling, i.e. the coupling to its nearest neighbor. Thus, at weak disorder, we want to use the nearest-neighbor coupling distribution $P_{NN}(J)$.
In contrast, at strong disorder, the pair model (cf. \autoref{ch:pair-localization-transition}) results in a different distribution of pair couplings $P_{pair}(J)$.
To compute these coupling distributions analytically, we go to the limit of vanishing blockade radius, i.e. $r_b\rightarrow 0$, and assume that spins are distributed randomly with uniform density $\rho$ in $d$ dimensional space. Fixing some spin, this gives us the number of spins in spherical shell of size $r$ and width $\mathrm{d}r$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:uniform-spin-distribution}
	w_u(r)\mathrm{d}r = d \rho \Omega_d r^{d-1}\mathrm{d}r = d\lambda (\lambda r)^{d-1}\mathrm{d}r
\end{equation}
where $\Omega_d = \frac{\pi^{d/2}}{\Gamma(n/2+1)}$ is the volume of a $d$-dimensional unit sphere and $\lambda^d = \rho \Omega_d$ is akin to the inverse mean distance between spins. We use this setup to compute both the distribution of nearest neighbor coupling $P_{NN}(J)$ and the distribution of pair couplings $P_{pair}(J)$ in the following sections.

\subsubsection{Nearest-neighbor coupling distribution $P_{NN}(J)$}

The distribution of the nearest neighbor couplings can be found using a simple ansatz~\cite{chandrasekharStochasticProblemsPhysics1943}. Consider some fixed spin and the density of spin $w(r)$ at distance $r$. Then, the probability $P_{NN}(r)$ of finding the nearest neighbor of that fixed spin at distance $r$ should be proportional to both the probability of having a spin in that distance and the probability of having no closer neighbor. This gives us the following integral-equation 
\begin{align}\label{eq:nn-integral-eq}
	P_{NN}(r) = w(r)*\left(1-\int_0^r \mathrm{d}r' P_{NN}(r')\right)
\end{align}
which can be solved straight-forwardly by noting that it has the form $f' = -w f$ and using separation of variables. The solution reads:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:nn-distribution}
	P_{NN}(r) = w(r)\exp\left(-\int_0^r \!\mathrm{d}r' w(r')\right)\quad.
\end{equation}

Plugging in the distance distribution for uniform spin density $w_u(r)$ (cf. \autoref{eq:uniform-spin-distribution}) gives us a so-called Weibull distribution:

\begin{align}\label{eq:weibull-distribution}
	P_{NN}(r) = d \lambda^d r^{d-1} \exp(- \lambda^d r^d)
\end{align}

Finally, changing variables\footnote{Note, the change of variables also needs to transform the measure, i.e. we transform $P(r)\mathrm{d}r \!\rightarrow\! P(J)\mathrm{d}J$} from distance $r$ to coupling $J=r^{-\alpha}$ yields the sought-after distribution of nearest-neighbor couplings

\begin{equation}\label{eq:P-NN-J}
	P_{NN}(J) = \beta\lambda^d J^{-\beta-1} \exp\left(-\lambda^d J^{-\beta}\right)
\end{equation}
where $\beta=\frac{d}{\alpha}$.

\subsubsection{Distribution of pair couplings $P_{pair}(J)$}
We can derive the distribution of pair lengths in a similar fashion to \autoref{eq:nn-integral-eq}. The key insight about the difference between a nearest neighbor and the partner of a pair in the RSRG sense is that the two partners of the pair are in some sense each other's partner. In contrast, the "nearest neighbor" property does not need to be reflexive. Denoting the pair coupling distribution as $P_{pair}(J)$, we write down the respective integral equation, which is very similar to \autoref{eq:nn-integral-eq}, except that the second factor gets squared because \emph{both spins} may not be part of a smaller pair:

\begin{align}\label{eq:pair-integral-eq}
	P_{pair}(r) = w(r)*\left(1-\int_0^r \mathrm{d}r' P_{pair}(r')\right)^2
\end{align}

This equation can be solved in the same way as \autoref{eq:nn-integral-eq} and yields
\footnote{\autoref{eq:pair-distribution} was derived by a different method for $d=3$ by former Master student Péter Kaposvári in his Master thesis~\cite{peterMasterThesis}.}:

\begin{align}\label{eq:pair-distribution}
	P_{pair}(r) = \frac{w(r)}{\left(1+\int_0^r\!\mathrm{d}r' w(r')\right)^2}
\end{align}

Employing the distance distribution for uniform spin density $w_u(r)$ (cf. \autoref{eq:uniform-spin-distribution}) again gives us that the pair distances follow a \emph{log-logistic distribution} for spins of uniform density:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:log-logistic-distribution}
	P_{pair}(r) = \frac{d\lambda^d r^{d-1}}{\left(1 + \lambda^d r^d\right)^2 }
\end{equation}

Changing to distance $r$ to coupling $J=r^{-\alpha}$ yields:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:P-pair-J}
	P_{pair}(J) = \frac{\beta\lambda^d J^{-\beta-1}}{\left(1+\lambda^{d}J^{-\beta}\right)^2}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Analytical steady-state magnetization}

	The inset shows a zoom around $\Omega=0$ to highlight the qualitative difference between the curves.
	}
	\label{fig:analytical-cusp}
\end{figure}

Having derived both the distribution of nearest-neighbor coupling $P_{NN}(J)$ (cf. \autoref{eq:P-NN-J}) and pair coupling distribution $P_{pair}(J)$ (cf. \autoref{eq:P-pair-J}), we can compute the steady-state magnetization of our simple model by using \autoref{eq:Cusp-simple-model-magnetization}:
\begin{align}
	M_{NN}(\Omega) &= \frac{1}{2}\int_0^{|\Omega|}\!\mathrm{d}J\ P_{NN}(J) = \frac{1}{2}\exp(-\lambda^d |\Omega|^{-\beta})\\
	M_{pair}(\Omega) &= \frac{1}{2}\int_0^{|\Omega|}\!\mathrm{d}J\ P_{pair}(J) = \frac{1}{2+2\lambda^{d}|\Omega|^{-\beta}}
\end{align}

The resulting curves, shown in \autoref{fig:analytical-cusp}, show the same qualitative features as their counterparts in \cite{franzEmergentPairLocalization2024}. Thus, this simple model gives us insight in the key mechanism behind the qualitative change of the steady-state magnetization behavior: At weak field $|\Omega|\ll 1$, the magnetization is determined by the weakest interactions $J<|\Omega|\ll 1$ which stem from long distances $r \gg 1$. For nearest neighbors, the distribution of distances is suppressed exponentially $\propto \exp(-r^d)$ (cf. \autoref{eq:weibull-distribution}), which creates the very smooth, round shape at weak field. Conversely, if the relevant lengths are given by the pairing procedure, the exponential suppression is weakened to an algebraic decay $\propto r^{-d-1}$. Intuitively, this is because while with increasing distance $r$ the number of potential partners increases, it also becomes less likely that they are still available. This competition then leads to a much slower decay of the relevant lengths resulting in enhanced sensitivity to the external magnetic field.

\subsubsection{Discussion}

\begin{figure}[htb]

	\includegraphics{part1/analytical_cusp_comparison_lorentz}
	\caption{Comparison of the two-component model (dashed lines) with another model where the constituents' magnetization is given by a Lorentzian (solid lines). (a) steady-state magnetization of the constituent. (b) predictions of both model for $\alpha=d=3$ [same parameters as \autoref{fig:analytical-cusp}(a)].
	}
	\label{fig:analytical-cusp-comparison-lorentz}
\end{figure}

The two-component model developed here is of course much simpler than the mean-field used in \cite{franzEmergentPairLocalization2024} but we argue that it captures the essential physics nonetheless. The two main conceptual differences are: The mean field model considers the magnetization response of pairs, which is a Lorentzian [cf. Eq.~(C3)], and additionally solves the equations self-consistently to capture the influence of a pairs magnetization on other pairs in the vicinity. The latter is responsible an the asymmetry of the ensemble's magnetization because the induced magnetization enhances (weakens) the effective magnetic field if external field and initial polarization are aligned (anti-aligned) to each other. This effect is showcased in \hyperlink{pub-Franz2022-Cusp.pdf.10}{Figure~4} in the appendix of \cite{franzEmergentPairLocalization2024}. However, apart from the asymmetry, the qualitative features remain unchanged.

To check the effect of the Lorentzian magnetization function, we can generalize the two-component model slightly at the cost of it being no longer analytically solvable. Conceptually, we replace the idea of "binary" spins, that are either locked by the field or dominated by interaction, by more general constituents that just follow some activation function, i.e. a function $m(\omega)$ that gives the resulting magnetization for a given ratio $\omega=\Omega/J$ of field strength $\Omega$ and relevant coupling $J$. Then the total steady-state magnetization reads

\begin{equation}\label{eq:generalized-two-component-model}
	\braket[1]{M(\Omega)} = \frac{1}{2}\int_0^{\infty}\!\mathrm{d}J P(J)m\left(\frac{\Omega}{J}\right).
\end{equation}
The two-component model is recovered with $m(\omega)=\Theta(\omega - 1)$ where $\Theta$ denotes the Heaviside function. For a pair, the magnetization follows a Lorentzian curve (cf. Equation C3 of \cite{franzEmergentPairLocalization2024}), which in this notation is given by $m_L(\omega) = \frac{\omega^2}{1+\omega^2}$. As \autoref{fig:analytical-cusp-comparison-lorentz} shows, this also does not significantly alter the qualitative behavior at weak external field. Thus, we conclude that the observed qualitative change of the steady-state magnetization stems from a fundamental change in character of the distribution of relevant couplings.
