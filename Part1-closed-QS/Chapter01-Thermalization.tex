\chapter{Concepts: Thermalization and absence thereof in closed quantum systems}\label{ch:concepts-thermalization}

In this chapter, we give a brief overview of the concepts relevant for \autoref{pt:spatial-disorder} of this thesis and establish the necessary context to interpret the results. However, we'll try to be brief and only summarize the essence of the matter. The interested reader is referred to the relevant literature for the details.
Since the distinction between thermalizing and localized systems is at the core of this part of the thesis, we start by reviewing the current understanding of the thermalization process in closed quantum systems in general and contrast this with the typical picture of how localized systems evade thermalization. In particular, we discuss localization in long-range and bond-disordered systems. We close this chapter with a high-level description of the Rydberg-based quantum simulation experiment which naturally implements the specific disordered Hamiltonian studied here.

\section{Thermalization in closed quantum systems}
\label{sec:Thermalization-in-closed-QS}
The simplest picture of thermalization in a classical system is perhaps the gas in a box which initially is confined to one of the sides (cf. \autoref{fig:gas-in-box}). Upon removing the constraint, the gas quickly spreads throughout the box and soon after a new equilibrium is reached. Interestingly, we can understand this process in a purely statistical way, without knowing about the precise equations of motion. As long as the dynamics sufficiently explore the configuration space, i.e. are \emph{ergodic}, we can postulate each possible configuration to be equally likely. This already explains why we find the gas to distribute itself throughout the box: There are just overwhelmingly more configurations where the particles occupy most of the box than configurations where the particles are concentrated, i.e. most configurations are \emph{typical}. With this ansatz, we could also compute how much force we would need on average to slowly compress the gas back to one side and how much kinetic energy this process adds. Thus, the presence of a thermal equilibrium grants us enormous predictive power.
The key features of a thermal equilibrium are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Loss of memory}: One cannot tell on which side of the box the gas started.
	\item \emph{Subsystem independence}: Every patch of space appears to be thermal with the same parameters (at least sufficiently away from the boundary).
	\item \emph{Independence of microscopic details}: The full state of the system can be described using just a few macroscopic quantities, namely in this case the total (kinetic) energy, the number of particles and the volume of the box.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[htb]

	\caption{Gas in box. (a) Initially all particles are confined to the left. (b) At a later time the gas has spread evenly throughout the box.}
	\label{fig:gas-in-box}
\end{figure}

Since quantum systems become computationally intractable much faster than classical systems, it would be very helpful if such an approach could be applied as well. Fortunately, for many quantum systems an analogue to classical thermalization can indeed be found, which we can only sketch here.
%However, the precise conditions under which a quantum system reaches thermal equilibrium are not fully understood and so one needs to check the validity of thermal descriptions on a case-by-case basis.
We refer the interested reader to one of the many great reviews on this topic for further details~\cite{gogolinEquilibrationThermalisationEmergence2016,dalessioQuantumChaosEigenstate2016,deutschEigenstateThermalizationHypothesis2018,moriThermalizationPrethermalizationIsolated2018}.

Consider some quantum system governed by a Hamiltonian $H$ which is prepared in some pure state $\ket{\psi(t)}=\ket{\psi_0}$ at $t=0$. Written in the energy eigenbasis $H\ket{k}=E_k\ket{k}$, the state at some later time $t$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
	\ket{\psi(t)} = e^{-iHt}\ket{\psi_0} = \sum_k e^{-iE_kt}\ket{k}\braket{k}{\psi_0}	= \sum_k c_k e^{-iE_kt}\ket{k}.
\end{equation}
Notably, due to the unitarity of the time evolution, the system's state at every time $t$ can be reversed to $t=0$ and thus the memory of the initial state is always preserved perfectly. This basic fact already means that we cannot expect \emph{every} observable to be captured by a thermal description of a few parameters.

However, in practice it is impossible to measure e.g. the expectation value of some projector onto a highly-entangled, many-body state. Thus, for practical applications it would be sufficient, if the expectation values of some \emph{simple observables} could be described by thermal ensembles. So suppose
we restrict ourselves to measuring the expectation value of some \emph{local observable} $O$ which only acts on a small subsystem $S$, i.e. can be written as $O=O_S\otimes \bbone_{\bar{S}}$. Writing out the evolution of the expectation value, we see
\begin{align}
	\braket[1]{O(t)} &= \braket[3]{\psi(t)}{O}{\psi(t)} \\
	& = \Tr \left[(O_S\otimes\bbone_{\bar{S}})\ketbra{\psi(t)}{\psi(t)}\right]\\
	& = \Tr O_S \Tr_{\bar S} \ketbra{\psi(t)}{\psi(t)}\\
	&= \Tr O_S \rho_S(t).
\end{align}
So the fact alone that we measure a property $O$ on a subsystem makes this measurement effectively equivalent to measuring $O$ on a mixed state! This simple observation is what enables equilibration and thermalization of local observables. Indeed, it has been shown that such a reduced state $\rho_S(t)$ is close to its equilibrium state
\begin{align}
	\omega_S &= \lim_{\tau\rightarrow\infty} \frac{1}{\tau} \int_{0}^{\tau}\!\mathrm{d}t \Tr_{\bar S}\rho(t)\\
	&= \Tr_{\bar S} \sum_k |c_k|^2 \ketbra{k}{k}\\
	&= \Tr_{\bar S} \omega
\end{align}\label{eq:diagonal-ensemble}
for most times $t$ under very mild conditions~\cite{reimannFoundationStatisticalMechanics2008,lindenQuantumMechanicalEvolution2009}. 
The equilibration to this so-called diagonal ensemble $\omega$ is not yet equivalent to thermalization~\cite{dziarmagaDynamicsQuantumPhase2010,polkovnikovColloquiumNonequilibriumDynamics2011}. For one $\omega$ still requires knowledge of an extensive amount of eigenstates occupation numbers  $|c_k|^2$ and additionally the system might take very long to equilibrate as the derivation relies on the dephasing of off-diagonal elements. So in the worst case, equilibration takes up until $t_{deph} \propto 1/\delta$ where $\delta=\min_{k,k'}|E_k-E_{k'}|$ is the smallest energy gap of the Hamiltonian which generally shrinks exponentially with increasing system size. 

To ensure thermalization additional assumptions are required. Considering the expectation value of $O$ with respect to the diagonal ensemble $\omega$
\begin{equation}
	\braket[1]{O}_{\omega} = \Tr O \omega = \sum_k |c_k|^2 \braket[3]{k}{O}{k},
\end{equation}
we can see that if all eigenstate expectation values $\braket[3]{k}{O}{k}$ are equal to some $\braket[3]{k}{O}{k}\approx O_{mc}$, then the precise distribution of $|c_k|^2$ is irrelevant and we have $\braket[1]{O}_{\omega} = O_{mc}$. This can be thought of the direct pendant to the typicality of microstates in classical thermalization. It seems reasonable to assume that this $O_{mc}=O_{mc}(E)$ is a smooth function of the energy because states of similar energy should be able to show wildly different properties. 
This assumption that $\braket[3]{k}{O}{k}=O_{mc}(E_k)$ is a smooth function for all eigenstates and all local observables called eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH)~\cite{deutschQuantumStatisticalMechanics1991,srednickiChaosQuantumThermalization1994,rigolThermalizationItsMechanism2008}. Of course, it appears to be a strong assumption but it is physically well motivated\footnote{There are also more mathematical motivations based on random matrix theory, see e.g.~\cite{dalessioQuantumChaosEigenstate2016}.} and indeed many systems have been shown to exhibit ETH.

\begin{figure}[htb!]

	\includegraphics{gfx/part1/ETH-thermalization}

Also shown are the respective prediction by the diagonal and microcanonical ensembles.}
	\label{fig:ETH-thermalization}
\end{figure}

However, ETH alone is not enough to ensure thermalization, we also need to demand that the $c_k$ are concentrated in the spectrum around some mean $\bar{E}$. Then we have indeed
\begin{align}
	\braket[1]{O}_{\omega} = O_{mc}(\bar{E}) = \braket[1]{O}_{mc}(\bar{E}),
\end{align}
where $\braket[1]{O}_{mc}(\bar{E})$ denotes the microcanonical ensemble expectation value at mean energy $\bar{E}$, i.e. the average over all eigenstates within a small energy window $[E-\Delta E, E+\Delta E]$. Physically, this restriction just means that one cannot expect extreme cases, e.g. a superposition of some state at low energy and another at high energy, to thermalize. Fortunately, these scenarios are rare. Usually, experiments initialize their systems in some reasonable state, e.g. product states with well-defined physical properties, which will also be concentrated in the spectrum due to ETH. 

We remark that thermalization according to ETH reflects the key features of thermal equilibrium defined in the beginning of this section: The precise initial state is irrelevant and the only information needed to describe its equilibrium properties is its average energy (assuming the absence of other conservation laws). In a sense ETH translates the concept of typicality from the classical world into the quantum realm by demanding that every eigenstate itself looks already thermal when probed locally. Since thermal states are usually highly mixed, this implies that eigenstates are highly entangled, i.e. feature \emph{volume-law entanglement} generically. This leads to the common sentiment that "the system acts as its own bath".

To conclude this introduction, \autoref{fig:ETH-thermalization} shows a comparison of two concrete systems where one thermalizes (blue) and one is subjected to strong disorder which can prohibit thermalization as described in the following sections. The model itself is a long-range Heisenberg model that will be studied throughout whole \autoref{pt:spatial-disorder} but the details are not relevant to recognize the striking difference between the weakly and strongly disordered cases. Panel (b) clearly shows that ETH is not fulfilled, eigenstate expectation values are highly discontinuous for the strongly disordered system. In contrast, for weak disorder they show no real energy dependence for the chosen observable (which is just the $z$-magnetization of a single spin). Similarly, but not as stark is the contrast for the eigenstate occupation numbers, i.e. the $|c_l|^2$, shown in panel (c) for the domain-wall state $\ket{\downarrow}^{\otimes 7}\ket{\uparrow}^{\otimes 6}$. This is a reasonable state and thus we can see that for weakly disordered system the eigenstate occupations cluster in the spectrum. Conversely for the strongly disordered system, they are spread roughly twice as far. Finally, these spectral properties are reflected in the time evolution of the expectation value of the chosen operator: While for thermalizing system the equilibrium value is reached quickly and agrees with the value obtained by the diagonal and microcanonical ensembles, for the non-thermal system the microcanonical prediction is very far from the actual values.

\section{Many-body localization}
\label{sec:MBL}
In 1958 Anderson discovered that a particle, that can hop between sites in a lattice with random on-site potentials, can become stuck completely~\cite{andersonAbsenceDiffusionCertain1958}. Thus, this simple system does not thermalize at all since the memory of the initial state, i.e. where the particle started, is retained at all times. This scenario, now known as \emph{Anderson localization}, was the starting point of a whole new branch of research on localization in disordered systems~\cite{imbrieReviewLocalIntegrals2017,abaninRecentProgressManybody2017,parameswaranEigenstatePhaseTransitions2017,abaninManybodyLocalizationThermalization2019,laflorencieEntanglementEntropyLocalization2022,sierantManyBodyLocalizationAge2024}.
It was later generalized from single particles to interacting many-body spin systems where the phenomenon is called \emph{many-body localization (MBL)} in honor to its conceptual predecessor~\cite{fleishmanInteractionsAndersonTransition1980,baskoMetalinsulatorTransitionWeakly2006,gornyiInteractingElectronsDisordered2005}.

The most studied model is the paradigmatic Heisenberg XXZ chain with random on-site potentials:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:XXZ-onsite}
	H_{XXZ} = J \sum_i \left(S_x^{(i)}S_x^{(i+1)} + S_y^{(i)}S_y^{(i+1)} + \Delta S_z^{(i)}S_z^{(i+1)}\right) + \sum_i h_i S_z^{(i)}
\end{equation}
Here $S_\alpha^{(i)}$ denotes the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ operator in direction $\alpha\in\{x,y,z\}$ on site $i$ and $h_i \sim \mathcal{U}[-W,W]$ are independently drawn from a uniform distribution. The width of this distribution $W$ thus regulates the strength of the disorder.
As found in many studies, this model exhibits a crossover from a thermalizing regime into a localized regime\footnote{In this work, we follow the terminology of \emph{regime} and \emph{phase} as coined by Morningstar et al.~\cite{morningstarAvalanchesManybodyResonances2022}.} at around $W_c \approx 3-4$ for $\Delta=1$~\cite{oganesyanLocalizationInteractingFermions2007,palManybodyLocalizationPhase2010,berkelbachConductivityDisorderedQuantum2010,delucaErgodicityBreakingModel2013,bauerAreaLawsManybody2013,nanduriEntanglementSpreadingManybody2014,luitzManybodyLocalizationEdge2015,serbynCriterionManybodyLocalizationdelocalization2015,barlevAbsenceDiffusionInteracting2015,devakulEarlyBreakdownAreaLaw2015,luitzExtendedSlowDynamical2016,maceMultifractalScalingsManyBody2019,loganManybodyLocalizationFock2019,chandaManybodyLocalizationTransition2020,tarziaManybodyLocalizationTransition2020,sierantPolynomiallyFilteredExact2020}.
This means that at sufficiently strong disorder $W>W_c$, the properties of this model differ dramatically from those of a thermalizing system. Most importantly: the eponymous absence of particle transport, which means that local excitations remain put and do not disperse. Note, entanglement can spread albeit very slowly~\cite{znidaricManyBodyLocalization2008,bardarsonUnboundedGrowthEntanglement2012,nanduriEntanglementSpreadingManybody2014,kiefer-emmanouilidisEvidenceUnboundedGrowth2020,luitzThereSlowParticle2020,huangExtensiveEntropyUnitary2021,chavezUltraslowGrowthNumber2023}.
From the spectral perspective, numerical studies confirmed the breakdown of ETH~\cite{kimTestingWhetherAll2014,albaEigenstateThermalizationHypothesis2015,mondainiEigenstateThermalizationTwodimensional2016,mierzejewskiEigenstateThermalizationHypothesis2020} and the related absence of volume-law entanglement of the eigenstates, which is replaced by \emph{are-law entanglement} across the whole spectrum~\cite{bauerAreaLawsManybody2013,geraedtsManybodyLocalizationThermalization2016}. 

%
%From the spectral perspective, the energy gap statistic changes from the Wigner-Dyson to a Poissonian distribution~\cite{oganesyanLocalizationInteractingFermions2007}, the eigenstates no longer exhibit volume-law entanglement and show area-law entanglement across the whole spectrum instead~\cite{bauerAreaLawsManybody2013,geraedtsManybodyLocalizationThermalization2016}, and ETH is no longer fulfilled~\cite{kimTestingWhetherAll2014,albaEigenstateThermalizationHypothesis2015,mondainiEigenstateThermalizationTwodimensional2016,mierzejewskiEigenstateThermalizationHypothesis2020}. The dynamical flip side of these properties can be summarized by absence of transport paired with very slow growth of entanglement~\cite{znidaricManyBodyLocalization2008,bardarsonUnboundedGrowthEntanglement2012,nanduriEntanglementSpreadingManybody2014,kiefer-emmanouilidisEvidenceUnboundedGrowth2020,luitzThereSlowParticle2020,huangExtensiveEntropyUnitary2021,chavezUltraslowGrowthNumber2023}.
%In short, the system exhibits an emergent integrability although it appears to be a fully interacting model at first glance!
%\FIXME{This emergent integrability is probably a bit of a logical leap...}

\subsection{LIOM picture}

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[]{part1/single-spin-localization-xxz}
	\caption{Real-space structure of a couple of eigenstates of the XXZ chain with random on-site potentials (cf. \autoref{eq:XXZ-onsite}) in the single excitation sector with $W=15$. The exponential tails are clearly visible.}
	\label{fig:xxz-singlespin-exponential-tails}
\end{figure}

The properties of a many-body localized system detailed above suggest the interpretation that strong disorder leads to the emergence of new, quasi-local, conservation laws.
This idea is further supported by the observation that the energy gap statistic changes from the Wigner-Dyson (typical for thermalizing systems) to a Poissonian distribution~\cite{oganesyanLocalizationInteractingFermions2007}, which is typical for integrable systems. For the model with on-site disorder as defined in \autoref{eq:XXZ-onsite}, it is natural to assume that each $S_z^{(i)}$ will be quasi-conserved in the limit of strong disorder $W\rightarrow\infty$.

Indeed, this perspective of a many-body localized system as an effectively integrable model unifies all the observations made above. It means we can find a basis transformation to write the Hamiltonian in terms of mutually commuting, quasi-local, conserved operators $\tau^{(i)}$, called "local integrals of motion" (LIOM) or "l-bits" such that~\cite{serbynLocalConservationLaws2013,swingleSimpleModelManybody2013,husePhenomenologyFullyManybodylocalized2014}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:l-bit-hamiltonian}
	H = \sum_i h_i \tau^{(i)} + \sum_{i,j} h_{i,j} \tau^{(i)}\tau^{(j)} \ldots
\end{equation}
Here quasi-local means that the operator should essentially act on a single site and decay quickly, i.e. exponentially, when moving away from that site. \autoref{fig:xxz-singlespin-exponential-tails} shows numerical result for a few eigenstates in the single-excitation sector of the model from \autoref{eq:XXZ-onsite}, where we can see that the spin occupies essentially a single site with the occupation decaying exponentially with distance to that site. 
%This means the spins are well and truly localized to a single site and an excitation cannot diffuse away.

Considering a system that can be approximated by a Hamiltonian of the form \autoref{eq:l-bit-hamiltonian}, we can see directly that none of the key features of thermalization defined above hold for MBL systems. Since each of the $\tau^{(i)}$ is quasi-local and conserved, some memory of the initial state can always be retrieved by local measurements. From this directly follows, that the measurement depends strongly on the choice of subsystem. However, the \emph{independence of microscopic details} is still partially given: The number of parameters grows with system size but only linearly in the number sites as expected for an integrable system. Thus, knowledge about the LIOMs is very useful and allows to make computations for large systems!

In general finding these LIOMs is not a trivial task. For models with random on-site potentials like \autoref{eq:XXZ-onsite}, one can guess that $\tau^{(i)}\approx S_z^{(i)}$ (see e.g.~\cite{adamiStructuralPropertiesLocal2022}) but for more complicated models like the long-range, bond-disordered system considered in the following chapters, it is not as obvious. While there exist different numerical schemes to compute LIOMs~\cite{chandranConstructingLocalIntegrals2015,mierzejewskiIdentifyingLocalQuasilocal2015,mierzejewskiApproximateConservationLaws2015,thomsonLocalIntegralsMotion2021,adamiStructuralPropertiesLocal2022}, we want to focus on gaining insight using an analytical approach falling under name of strong disorder renormalization group or real-space renormalization group (RSRG)~\cite{dasguptaLowtemperaturePropertiesRandom1980,fisherRandomTransverseField1992,fisherRandomAntiferromagneticQuantum1994,igloiStrongDisorderRG2005,voskManybodyLocalizationOne2013,voskTheoryManyBodyLocalization2015,parameswaranEigenstatePhaseTransitions2017,monthusStrongDisorderRenormalization2018,igloiStrongDisorderRG2018}.

%\subsection{MBL in the presence of long-range interactions}
\subsection{MBL in long-range, bond-disordered systems}
Considering the mental model for MBL, described above, which is caused by random on-site potentials, it is natural to assume that both stronger and more long-range interactions should be detrimental to localization. Consider a long-range version of \autoref{eq:XXZ-onsite} such as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:long-range-on-site-XXZ}
	H = \sum_{i,j} \frac{J_{ij}}{|r_i-r_j|^\alpha} \left(S_x^{(i)}S_x^{(j)} + S_y^{(i)}S_y^{(j)} + \Delta_{ij} S_z^{(i)}S_z^{(j)}\right) + \sum_i h_i S_z^{(i)},
\end{equation}
where $|J_{ij}|=O(1)$, $r_i$ are the locations of the spins and $\alpha$ regulates the spatial decay of the interaction.
For this type of model, there are arguments restricting the presence of MBL based on the amount of possible \emph{resonances} for a spin. In this context, two spins $i$ and $j$ are in resonance if their coupling $J_{ij}$ is larger than the energy difference $|h_i-h_j|$ due to the random potentials.
Given a system with spatial dimension $d$, resonance counting rules out localization if $\alpha \leq 2d$ for systems with $|\Delta_{ij}| >0$~\cite{burinEnergyDelocalizationStrongly2006,yaoManyBodyLocalizationDipolar2014,burinManybodyDelocalizationStrongly2015,gutmanEnergyTransportAnderson2016} or $\alpha \leq 1.5d$ in the case of an XX model, i.e. $\Delta=0$~\cite{burinLocalizationRandomXY2015}. Later numerical works supported these predictions by numerically studying systems of $< 40$ spins~\cite{schifferManybodyLocalizationSpin2019,safavi-nainiQuantumDynamicsDisordered2019,yousefjaniMobilityEdgeLongrange2023}.

%Powerlaw with random on-site potentials chain:\\ \cite{safavi-nainiQuantumDynamicsDisordered2019} confirm MBL using dynamics, half-chain entanglement entropy grows with $1/\alpha$. Different critical $\alpha_c$ for XX ($\alpha_c\sim1$) and XXX ($\alpha_c\sim2$). \\

Conceptually, these works continue the train of thought from models where random on-site potentials are the source of MBL and generalize to power-law interactions with random coefficients. However, there is also a complementary approach, when starting at models, where MBL is caused solely by disordered interactions, e.g. models like
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bond-disordered-XXZ}
	H = \sum_{i} J_{i} \left(S_x^{(i)}S_x^{(i+1)} + S_y^{(i)}S_y^{(i+1)} + \Delta_i S_z^{(i)}S_z^{(i+1)}\right),
\end{equation}
where the $J_{i}$ are independently drawn from some distribution. These \emph{bond-disordered} models also feature MBL (see e.g.~\cite{vasseurParticleholeSymmetryManybody2016}) but the LIOMs are much less obvious. They are usually tackled by the real-space renormalization group (RSRG) technique (see~\cite{igloiStrongDisorderRG2005,parameswaranEigenstatePhaseTransitions2017,igloiStrongDisorderRG2018,monthusStrongDisorderRenormalization2018} for reviews). 
The general principle of the RSRG approach is to iteratively eliminate the strongest bond of the system by freezing the spins sharing this bond into one of the eigenstates of their interaction Hamiltonian and deriving new couplings for surrounding spins perturbatively. This is a good approximation, if the system is sufficiently disordered such that the strongest bond dominates all other couplings in its vicinity. Interestingly, the elimination step \emph{increases} the disorder in the system, such that each successive elimination makes less and less error~\cite{fisherRandomAntiferromagneticQuantum1994}. Thus, the system's coupling distribution flows towards the \emph{infinite randomness fixed point} where the elimination step becomes exact and the coupling distribution converges to a power-law distribution. Originally, RSRG was used to find the ground state properties of bond-disordered systems~\cite{dasguptaLowtemperaturePropertiesRandom1980,bhattScalingStudiesHighly1982,fisherRandomTransverseField1992,fisherRandomAntiferromagneticQuantum1994,fisherCriticalBehaviorRandom1995} and was generalized later to also compute dynamical properties~\cite{voskManybodyLocalizationOne2013,voskDynamicalQuantumPhase2014,masonTimedependentRealspaceRenormalizationGroup2019,ruggieroQuantumInformationSpreading2022} or study excited states~\cite{pekkerHilbertGlassTransitionNew2014,vasseurQuantumCriticalityHot2015,vasseurParticleholeSymmetryManybody2016}.
This line of work culminated in a general theory of the MBL transition for these one-dimensional, bond-disordered, model with nearest neighbor interactions~\cite{voskTheoryManyBodyLocalization2015}.

Generalizing nearest-neighbor, bond-disordered models to power-law interactions does not significantly change the story from the perspective of the RSRG approach and localization is predicted to persist even without on-site potentials~\cite{moureManyBodyLocalizationTransition2015,moureDisorderedQuantumSpin2018,kutlinRenormalizationLocalizationSmall2020}. Subsequently, numerical studies in small systems confirmed the presence of a localization crossover~\cite{mohdebEntanglementPropertiesDisordered2020,mohdebExcitedEigenstateEntanglementProperties2022,mohdebGlobalQuenchDynamics2023}.
This causes tension with the resonance counting arguments which predict the total absence of localization, because without on-site potentials every spin is considered in resonance with every other spin.
This dramatic difference ultimately boils down to the treatment of resonances: Where resonance counting treats every possible resonance on the same footing, RSRG essentially considers only the strongest resonance and eliminates it perturbatively. This elimination assumes a strong hierarchy of interaction timescales associated with the resonances. After the elimination, the other previously possible resonances are no longer resonant with the newly created states. In the end, it boils down to whether the RSRG perspective is justified, i.e. whether a given system has a strong enough separation of scales locally. 
% is it true MBL? different phenomenology -> e.g. aramthottilPhenomenologyManybodyLocalization2024
In this thesis, we aim to contribute to an answer by studying a system that can also be realized by a Rydberg-based quantum simulator to examine the validity of the RSRG prescription in large system. The specific experiment is introduced in the next section.

%While localization in bond-disordered models does not cause tension to the results from resonance counting for nearest neighbor interaction due to the limited interaction range. However most quantum simulation experiments based on atoms or molecules feature power-law interactions due to the electronic interactions. 

%Recently, these branches of bond-disordered systems and long-range interactions came into contact due to the study of long-range models without on-site disorder. While resonance counting arguments would predict the complete absence of localization, since all spins are considered to be resonant, numerical studies showed signs of localization.

%In this context, the first part of this thesis first studies localization in a power-law interacting XXZ  model with specific disorder arising from random positions subject to a blockade condition. Our main focus lies not on the question whether this model exhibits true MBL in the limit of infinite system size and/or at very late times. Rather, we aim to use MBL as a practical tool to gain insight in the dynamics and properties of the model at experimentally accessible scales. For this, we first employ numerical methods to establish that small systems 

%This is a different regime than what I study where the main disorder does not stem from random potentials but is due to widely varying interaction strengths. To make this difference clear, I note that without random fields, these early works claim MBL to be impossible, as any spin is resonant with every other spin. However, RSRG tells us that each spin effectively on interacts with its \emph{strongest} resonant partner. Their fast interaction then effectively decouples the pair from the rest of the spins. That's why this resonance counting is not relevant for localization for truly bond-disordered systems and raises the question about possible differences between random field models with some random long-range interaction and bond-disordered models with some random fields.


%Interestingly, even in ordered systems with very long-range interaction $\alpha<1$ ETH is violated~\cite{sugimotoEigenstateThermalizationLongRange2022,chengManybodyLocalizationClean2023}.

%heuristic resonance counting, no MBL for $\alpha\leq d$ in XXZ or Anderson model \cite{burinEnergyDelocalizationStrongly2006} with somewhat mixed behavior for $\alpha\leq 2d$ (Anderson localization at zero temperature, other pair forms for Yao XXZ). 
%
%Refined by  for XX model to $\alpha > \frac{3d}{2}$.
