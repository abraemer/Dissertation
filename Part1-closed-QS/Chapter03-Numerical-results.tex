\chapter{Pair localization transition}

Natural first question: Does this system exhibit a localization transition? If so: what are the conserved quantities? To tackle this question, we study the level-spacing ration, the half-chain entanglement entropy of eigenstates, Thouless parameters with respect to different local observables and participation ratios with different bases.

can we exploit the knowledge about the conserved quantities to make numerics more efficient?
