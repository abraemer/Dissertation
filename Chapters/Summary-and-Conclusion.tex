\chapter*{Summary}
\label{pt:summary}
Two routes to non-thermalization (or to avoid thermalization at the usual short timescales) that both generate effectively conserved quantities in a subtle way.

Bond-disordered systems are much more interesting than no-site disorder. More stable localization, but seems to not stabilize time crystalline signatures.
