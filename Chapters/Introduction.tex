Some nice introduction.\marginpar{I can put things in the margin.}

Let's cite everything\cite{braemerPairLocalizationDipolar2022,eulerMetronomeSpinStabilizes2024,franzEmergentPairLocalization2022,franzObservationUniversalRelaxation2023,geierTimereversalDipolarQuantum2024,braemerClusterTruncatedWigner2024}. And some more\cite{luitzHowSmallQuantum2017,nandkishoreManyBodyLocalized2017}.

Classical ice cream always melts, when forgotten on a table or, as a physicist might say, it thermalizes as do all classical systems without too many conservation laws. However, in the quantum realm things might be more complicated. While it is observed that in fact most quantum systems will reach some sort of equilibrium, it is generally poorly understood whether this state can be considered thermal.
