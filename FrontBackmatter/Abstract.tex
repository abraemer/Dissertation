In this thesis, we study the thermalization properties in both closed and periodically driven systems subject to spatial inhomogeneities. 
In Part 1, we focus on long-range Heisenberg spin models of spatially disordered spins which can be realized experimentally by current state-of-the-art platforms.
We find numerically that the disordered couplings induced by the randomly positioned spins can lead to a many-body localized regime. Using perturbative arguments based on the real-space renormalization group, we demonstrate that the emergent quasi-conserved quantities are arise from pairs of strongly interacting spins decoupling from their environment. Predictions from the resulting effective model of pairs are compared to real experimental data from a Rydberg quantum simulator for validation and are found to be highly accurate.
In Part 2, we shift our focus to periodically driven systems which are known to exhibit long-lived (meta-)stable states under certain conditions. Specifically, we consider an ordered Ising model subject to a driving field of varying strength across different parts of the chain. We demonstrate that a configuration where the driving field has the same strength for all spins except one can dramatically prolong time-crystalline signatures. We link this behavior to the presence of approximate conservation laws stabilized by the spatial inhomogeneity.
