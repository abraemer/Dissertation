\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
First, I would like to thank my supervisor \emph{Martin Gärttner} for the great time I was allowed to spend within his group. Well, in the beginning when I started my master project, there was not much of a group but it steadily grew over time into its current size. Throughout, the atmosphere was always open, engaged and friendly, which really is a reflection of your mentality. I really appreciate that I could seek your advice at anytime and you always expressed excitement about my/our work. I will always remember my time spent with you and the group fondly.

Second, I want to thank my co-advisor \emph{Matthias Weidemüller} for the opportunity to work in so close collaboration with experiment. To me this was an ideal environment, where I could solve puzzles that actually have a counterpart in the real world. %I also thoroughly discussing physics with you and learned a lot in the process.

I also thank \emph{Tilman Enss} for reviewing this thesis and the further members of my committee \emph{Selim Jochim} and \emph{Werner Aeschbach}.
