\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
First, I would like to thank my supervisor \emph{Martin Gärttner} for the great time I was allowed to spend within his group. Well, in the beginning when I started (for my master project), there was not much of a group but it steadily grew over time into its current size. Throughout, the atmosphere was always open, engaged and friendly, which really is a reflection of your mentality. I really appreciate that I could seek your advice at anytime and you always expressed excitement about my/our work. I will always remember my time spent with you and the group fondly.

Second, I want to thank my co-advisor \emph{Matthias Weidemüller} for the opportunity to work in so close collaboration with experiment. To me this was an ideal environment, where I could solve puzzles that actually have a counterpart in the real world. %I thoroughly enjoyed discussing physics with you and learned a lot in the process.

I also thank \emph{Tilman Enss} for reviewing this thesis and the further members of my committee \emph{Selim Jochim} and \emph{Werner Aeschbach}.

Although briefly mentioned above, I want to express my appreciation for all of my colleagues from the MBQD group. You all (and this includes past members in HD as well as the new crew in Jena) contributed to make this a enjoyable time - be it on our retreats or just during normal work.
I want to make a couple special shout-outs. Starting with \emph{Niklas Euler}, with whom I had the pleasure of sharing my office and from whom I learned the secrets of cooking with Seitan. Further I want to shout-out my norse namesake \emph{Adrian \AA sen} with whom I went on an epic quest to see the northern lights and experience the polar night. \emph{Javad Vahedi}, I really enjoyed our discussions about numerics and programming.

Finally, I am very grateful for the continuous support of my friends and family. Extra special love goes out to my wonderful partner Brini, who always was there for me when I needed her.
I am very grateful to have you in my life and I very much look forward to less stressful times to enjoy together with you.
