  abstract = {This study presents a comprehensive numerical investigation of the application of the cluster Truncated Wigner Approximation (cTWA) for modelling quench dynamics in bond-disordered Heisenberg spin chains with power-law interactions.  We find that cTWA bears the potential to yield highly accurate results over a wide parameter range. However, its accuracy hinges on the correct choice of clusters and we show that using a clustering strategy inspired by the strong disorder renormalisation group (SDRG)/real-space renormalization group (RSRG) leads to essentially exact results in the regime of strong disorder while only employing clusters of 2 spins. Surprisingly, even for rather weak disorder, e.g. in the presence of very long-range interactions, this choice of clustering outperforms a naive choice of clusters of consecutive spins. Additionally, we develop a discrete sampling scheme for the initial Wigner function, as an alternative to the originally introduced scheme based on Gaussian approximations. This sampling scheme conceptually it puts cTWA on similar footing as regular dTWA for single spins unifying the approaches and yields some reduction in the Monte Carlo shot noise compared to the Gaussian scheme.},

  abstract = {Strongly interacting quantum systems subject to quenched disorder exhibit intriguing phenomena such as glassiness and many-body localization. Theoretical studies have mainly focused on disorder in the form of random potentials, while many experimental realizations naturally feature disorder in the interparticle inter- actions. Inspired by cold Rydberg gases, where such disorder can be engineered using the dipole blockade effect, we study a Heisenberg XXZ spin model where the disorder is exclusively due to random spin-spin couplings, arising from power-law interactions between randomly positioned spins. Using established spectral and eigenstate properties and entanglement entropy, we show that this system exhibits a localization crossover and identify strongly interacting pairs as emergent local conserved quantities in the system, leading to an intuitive physical picture consistent with our numerical results.},

  abstract = {We investigate a disorder-free quantum Ising chain subject to a time-periodic drive that rotates each spin by an angle {$\pi$}‚Å¢(1-{$\epsilon$}\textsubscript{i}). In case all spins experience the same deviation {$\epsilon$} and the system is initialized in a fully polarized state, the dynamics is known to be time crystalline: the magnetization of the system exhibits period-doubled oscillations for timescales that grow exponentially with the length of the chain. In this work, we study the effect of a deviation {$\epsilon$} that differs between spins. We find that reducing {$\epsilon$} for a single spin drastically enhances the lifetime of spatiotemporal order, suggesting the name metronome spin. Employing perturbative arguments in an average Hamiltonian picture, we explain this observation for initial states with macroscopic bulk magnetization. Furthermore, in the case of random bit-string initial states, we report the enhancement of the lifetime of a topological edge mode, which can also be understood in the same picture. Finally, we discuss an altered geometry in which the metronome spin is not directly part of the chain, affecting the dynamics in different ways in the two scenarios considered. Our findings unveil the intricate dynamics that emerge in Floquet systems under the influence of a spatially varying drive, thereby uncovering new avenues for Floquet engineering.},

  abstract = {Understanding how closed quantum systems dynamically approach thermal equilibrium presents a major unresolved problem in statistical physics. Generically, non-integrable quantum systems are expected to thermalize as they comply with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis. However, in the presence of strong disorder, the dynamics can possibly slow down to a degree that systems fail to thermalize on experimentally accessible timescales, as in spin glasses or many-body localized systems. In general, particularly in long-range interacting quantum systems, the specific nature of the disorder necessary for the emergence of a prethermal, metastable state--distinctly separating the timescales of initial relaxation and subsequent slow thermalization--remains an open question. We study an ensemble of Heisenberg spins with a tunable distribution of random coupling strengths realized by a Rydberg quantum simulator. We observe a drastic change in the late-time magnetization when increasing disorder strength. The data is well described by models based on pairs of strongly interacting spins, which are treated as thermal for weak disorder and isolated for strong disorder. Our results indicate a crossover into a pair-localized prethermal regime in a closed quantum system of thousands of spins in the critical case where the exponent of the power law interaction matches the spatial dimension.},

  abstract = {A major goal toward understanding far-from-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems consists in finding indications of universality in the sense that the dynamics no longer depends on microscopic details of the system. We realize a large range of many-body spin systems on a Rydberg atom quantum simulator by choosing appropriate Rydberg state combinations. We use this platform to compare the magnetization relaxation dynamics of disordered Heisenberg XX-, XXZ- and Ising Hamiltonians in a scalable fashion. After appropriate rescaling of evolution time, all the dynamics collapse onto a single curve. We find that the observed behavior is approximately captured by an integrable model that only considers local pairs of spins. These pairs exhibit oscillations independent of the type of Hamiltonian which explains the universal character of relaxation dynamics of disordered Heisenberg quantum spin systems.},

  abstract = {Time reversal in a macroscopic system is contradicting daily experience. It is practically impossible to restore a shattered cup to its original state by just time reversing the microscopic dynamics that led to its breakage. Yet, with the precise control capabilities provided by modern quantum technology, the unitary evolution of a quantum system can be reversed in time. Here, we implement a time-reversal protocol in a dipolar interacting, isolated many-body spin system represented by Rydberg states in an atomic gas. By changing the states encoding the spin, we flip the sign of the interaction Hamiltonian, and demonstrate the reversal of the relaxation dynamics of the magnetization by letting a demagnetized many-body state evolve back-in-time into a magnetized state. We elucidate the role of atomic motion using the concept of a Loschmidt echo. Finally, by combining the approach with Floquet engineering, we demonstrate time reversal for a large family of spin models with different symmetries. Our method of state transfer is applicable across a wide range of quantum simulation platforms and has applications far beyond quantum many-body physics, reaching from quantum-enhanced sensing to quantum information scrambling.},
